houses above a certain rent are women. If a married couple come to settle in the town, somehow the gentleman disappears; he is either fairly frightened to death by being the only man in the Cranford evening parties, or he is accounted for by being with his regiment, his ship, or closely engaged in business all the week in the great neighbouring commercial town of Drumble, distant only twenty miles on a railroad. In short, whatever does become of the gentlemen, they are not at Cranford. What could they do if they were there? The surgeon has his round of thirty miles, and sleeps at Cranford; but every man cannot be a surgeon. For keeping the trim gardens full of choice flowers without a weed to speck them; for frightening away little boys who look wistfully at the said flowers through the railings; for rushing out at the geese that occasionally venture in to the gardens if the gates are left open; for deciding all questions of literature and politics without troubling themselves with unnecessary reasons or arguments; for obtaining clear and correct knowledge of everybody\u2019s affairs in the parish; for keeping their neat maid-servants in admirable order; for kindness (somewhat dictatorial) to the poor, and real tender good offices to each other whenever they are in distress, the ladies of Cranford are quite sufficient. \u201cA man,\u201d as one of them observed to me once, \u201cis so in the way in the house!\u201d Although the ladies of Cranford know all each other\u2019s proceedings, they are exceedingly indifferent to each other\u2019s opinions. Indeed, as each has her own individuality, not to say eccentricity, pretty strongly developed, nothing is so easy as verbal retaliation; but, somehow, good-will reigns among them to a considerable degree.\n\nThe Cranford ladies have only an occasional little quarrel, spirited out in a few peppery words and angry jerks of the head; just enough to prevent the even tenor of their lives from becoming too flat. Their dress is very independent of fashion; as they observe, \u201cWhat does it signify how we dress here at Cranford, where everybody knows us?\u201d And if they go from home, their reason is equally cogent, \u201cWhat does it signify how we dress here, where nobody knows us?\u201d The materials of their clothes are, in general, good and plain, and most of them are nearly as scrupulous as Miss Tyler, of cleanly memory; but I will answer for it, the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in wear in England, was seen in Cranford\u2014and seen without a smile.\n\nA magnificent family red silk umbrella\n\nI can testify to a magnificent family red silk umbrella, under which a gentle little spinster, left alone of many brothers and sisters, used to patter to church on rainy days. Have you any red silk umbrellas in London? We had a tradition of the first that had ever been seen in Cranford; and the little boys mobbed it, and called it \u201ca stick in petticoats.\u201d It might have been the very red silk one I have described, held by a strong father over a troop of little ones; the poor little lady\u2014the survivor of all\u2014could scarcely carry it.\n\nThen there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls; and they were announced to any young people who might be staying in the town, with all the solemnity with which the old Manx laws were read once a year on the Tinwald Mount.\n\n\u201cOur friends have sent to inquire how you are after your journey to-night, my dear\u201d (fifteen miles in a gentleman\u2019s carriage); \u201cthey will give you some rest to-morrow, but the next day, I have no doubt, they will call; so be at liberty after twelve\u2014from twelve to three are our calling hours.\u201d\n\nThen, after they had called\u2014\n\n\u201cIt is the third day; I dare say your mamma has told you, my dear, never to let more than three days elapse between receiving a call and returning it; and also, that you are never to stay longer than a quarter of an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut am I to look at my watch? How am I to find out when a quarter of an hour has passed?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must keep thinking about the time, my dear, and not allow yourself to forget it in conversation.\u201d\n\nAs everybody had this rule in their minds, whether they received or paid a call, of course no absorbing subject was ever spoken about. We kept ourselves to short sentences of small talk, and were punctual to our time.\n\nI imagine that a few of the gentlefolks of Cranford were poor, and had some difficulty in making both ends meet; but they were like the Spartans, and concealed their smart under a smiling face. We none of us spoke of money, because that subject savoured of commerce and trade, and though some might be poor, we were all aristocratic. The Cranfordians had that kindly esprit de corps which made them overlook all deficiencies in success when some among them tried to conceal their poverty. When Mrs Forrester, for instance, gave a party in her baby-house of a dwelling, and the little maiden disturbed the ladies on the sofa by a request that she might get the tea-tray out from underneath, everyone took this novel proceeding as the most natural thing in the world, and talked on about household forms and ceremonies as if we all believed that our hostess had a regular servants\u2019 hall, second table, with housekeeper and steward, instead of the one little charity-school maiden, whose short ruddy arms could never have been strong enough to carry the tray upstairs, if she had not been assisted in private by her mistress, who now sat in state, pretending not to know what cakes were sent up, though she knew, and we knew, and she knew that we knew, and we knew that she knew that we knew, she had been busy all the morning making tea-bread and sponge-cakes.\n\nThere were one or two consequences arising from this general but unacknowledged poverty, and this very much acknowledged gentility, which were not amiss, and which might be introduced into many circles of society to their great improvement. For instance, the inhabitants of Cranford kept early hours, and clattered home in their pattens, under the guidance of a lantern-bearer, about nine o\u2019clock at night; and the whole town was abed and asleep by half-past ten. Moreover, it was considered \u201cvulgar\u201d (a tremendous word in Cranford) to give anything expensive, in the way of eatable or drinkable, at the evening entertainments. Wafer bread-and-butter and sponge-biscuits were all that the Honourable Mrs Jamieson gave; and she was sister-in-law to the late Earl of Glenmire, although she did practise such \u201celegant economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cElegant economy!\u201d How naturally one falls back into the phraseology of Cranford! There, economy was always \u201celegant,\u201d and money-spending always \u201cvulgar and ostentatious\u201d; a sort of sour-grapeism which made us very peaceful and satisfied. I never shall forget the dismay felt when a certain Captain Brown came to live at Cranford, and openly spoke about his being poor\u2014not in a whisper to an intimate friend, the doors and windows being previously closed, but in the public street! in a loud military voice! alleging his poverty as a reason for not taking a particular house. The ladies of Cranford were already rather moaning over the invasion of their territories by a man and a gentleman. He was a half-pay captain, and had obtained some situation on a neighbouring railroad, which had been vehemently petitioned against by the little town; and if, in addition to his masculine gender, and his connection with the obnoxious railroad, he was so brazen as to talk of being poor\u2014why, then, indeed, he must be sent to Coventry. Death was as true and as common as poverty; yet people never spoke about that, loud out in the streets. It was a word not to be mentioned to ears polite. We had tacitly agreed to ignore that any with whom we associated on terms of visiting equality could ever be prevented by poverty from doing anything that they wished. If we walked to or from a party, it was because the night was so fine, or the air so refreshing, not because sedan-chairs were expensive. If we wore prints, instead of summer silks, it was because we preferred a washing material; and so on, till we blinded ourselves to the vulgar fact that we were, all of us, people of very moderate means. Of course, then, we did not know what to make of a man who could speak of poverty as if it was not a disgrace. Yet, somehow, Captain Brown made himself respected in Cranford, and was called upon, in spite of all resolutions to the contrary. I was surprised to hear his opinions quoted as authority at a visit which I paid to Cranford about a year after he had settled in the town. My own friends had been among the bitterest opponents of any proposal to visit the Captain and his daughters, only twelve months before; and now he was even admitted in the tabooed hours before twelve. True, it was to discover the cause of a smoking chimney, before the fire was lighted; but still Captain Brown walked upstairs, nothing daunted, spoke in a voice too large for the room, and joked quite in the way of a tame man about the house. He had been blind to all the small slights, and omissions of trivial ceremonies, with which he had been received. He had been friendly, though the Cranford ladies had been cool; he had answered small sarcastic compliments in good faith; and with his manly frankness had overpowered all the shrinking which met him as a man who was not ashamed to be poor. And, at last, his excellent masculine common sense, and his facility in devising expedients to overcome domestic dilemmas, had gained him an extraordinary place as authority among the Cranford ladies. He himself went on in his course, as unaware of his popularity as he had been of the reverse; and I am sure he was startled one day when he found his advice so highly esteemed as to make some counsel which he had given in jest to be taken in sober, serious earnest.\n\nIt was on this subject: An old lady had an Alderney cow, which she looked upon as a daughter. You could not pay the short quarter of an hour call without being told of the wonderful milk or wonderful intelligence of this animal. The whole town knew and kindly regarded Miss Betsy Barker\u2019s Alderney; therefore great was the sympathy and regret when, in an unguarded moment, the poor cow tumbled into a lime-pit. She moaned so loudly that she was soon heard and rescued; but meanwhile the poor beast had lost most of her hair, and came out looking naked, cold, and miserable, in a bare skin. Everybody pitied the animal, though a few could not restrain their smiles at her droll appearance. Miss Betsy Barker absolutely cried with sorrow and dismay; and it was said she thought of trying a bath of oil. This remedy, perhaps, was recommended by some one of the number whose advice she asked; but the proposal, if ever it was made, was knocked on the head by Captain Brown\u2019s decided \u201cGet her a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers, ma\u2019am, if you wish to keep her alive. But my advice is, kill the poor creature at once.\u201d\n\nMiss Betsy Barker dried her eyes, and thanked the Captain heartily; she set to work, and by-and-by all the town turned out to see the Alderney meekly going to her pasture, clad in dark grey flannel. I have watched her myself many a time. Do you ever see cows dressed in grey flannel in London?\n\nMeekly going to her pasture\n\nCaptain Brown had taken a small house on the outskirts of the town, where he lived with his two daughters. He must have been upwards of sixty at the time of the first visit I paid to Cranford after I had left it as a residence. But he had a wiry, well-trained, elastic figure, a stiff military throw-back of his head, and a springing step, which made him appear much younger than he was. His eldest daughter looked almost as old as himself, and betrayed the fact that his real was more than his apparent age. Miss Brown must have been forty; she had a sickly, pained, careworn expression on her face, and looked as if the gaiety of youth had long faded out of sight. Even when young she must have been plain and hard-featured. Miss Jessie Brown was ten years younger than her sister, and twenty shades prettier. Her face was round and dimpled. Miss Jenkyns once said, in a passion against Captain Brown (the cause of which I will tell you presently), \u201cthat she thought it was time for Miss Jessie to leave off her dimples, and not always to be trying to look like a child.\u201d It was true there was something childlike in her face; and there will be, I think, till she dies, though she should live to a hundred. Her eyes were large blue wondering eyes, looking straight at you; her nose was unformed and snub, and her lips were red and dewy; she wore her hair, too, in little rows of curls, which heightened this appearance. I do not know whether she was pretty or not; but I liked her face, and so did everybody, and I do not think she could help her dimples. She had something of her father\u2019s jauntiness of gait and manner; and any female observer might detect a slight difference in the attire of the two sisters\u2014that of Miss Jessie being about two pounds per annum more expensive than Miss Brown\u2019s. Two pounds was a large sum in Captain Brown\u2019s annual disbursements.\n\nSuch was the impression made upon me by the Brown family when I first saw them all together in Cranford Church. The Captain I had met before\u2014on the occasion of the smoky chimney, which he had cured by some simple alteration in the flue. In church, he held his double eye-glass to his eyes during the Morning Hymn, and then lifted up his head erect and sang out loud and joyfully. He made the responses louder than the clerk\u2014an old man with a piping feeble voice, who, I think, felt aggrieved at the Captain\u2019s sonorous bass, and quivered higher and higher in consequence.\n\nOn coming out of church, the brisk Captain paid the most gallant attention to his two daughters. He nodded and smiled to his acquaintances; but he shook hands with none until he had helped Miss Brown to unfurl her umbrella, had relieved her of her prayer-book, and had waited patiently till she, with trembling nervous hands, had taken up her gown to walk through the wet roads.\n\nI wonder what the Cranford ladies did with Captain Brown at their parties. We had often rejoiced, in former days, that there was no gentleman to be attended to, and to find conversation for, at the card-parties. We had congratulated ourselves upon the snugness of the evenings; and, in our love for gentility, and distaste of mankind, we had almost persuaded ourselves that to be a man was to be \u201cvulgar\u201d; so that when I found my friend and hostess, Miss Jenkyns, was going to have a party in my honour, and that Captain and the Miss Browns were invited, I wondered much what would be the course of the evening. Card-tables, with green baize tops, were set out by daylight, just as usual; it was the third week in November, so the evenings closed in about four. Candles, and clean packs of cards, were arranged on each table. The fire was made up; the neat maid-servant had received her last directions; and there we stood, dressed in our best, each with a candle-lighter in our hands, ready to dart at the candles as soon as the first knock came. Parties in Cranford were solemn festivities, making the ladies feel gravely elated as they sat together in their best dresses. As soon as three had arrived, we sat down to \u201cPreference,\u201d I being the unlucky fourth. The next four comers were put down immediately to another table; and presently the tea-trays, which I had seen set out in the store-room as I passed in the morning, were placed each on the middle of a card-table. The china was delicate egg-shell; the old-fashioned silver glittered with polishing; but the eatables were of the slightest description. While the trays were yet on the tables, Captain and the Miss Browns came in; and I could see that, somehow or other, the Captain was a favourite with all the ladies present. Ruffled brows were smoothed, sharp voices lowered at his approach. Miss Brown looked ill, and depressed almost to gloom. Miss Jessie smiled as usual, and seemed nearly as popular as her father. He immediately and quietly assumed the man\u2019s place in the room; attended to every one\u2019s wants, lessened the pretty maid-servant\u2019s labour by waiting on empty cups and bread-and-butterless ladies; and yet did it all in so easy and dignified a manner, and so much as if it were a matter of course for the strong to attend to the weak, that he was a true man throughout. He played for threepenny points with as grave an interest as if they had been pounds; and yet, in all his attention to strangers, he had an eye on his suffering daughter\u2014for suffering I was sure she was, though to many eyes she might only appear to be irritable. Miss Jessie could not play cards: but she talked to the sitters-out, who, before her coming, had been rather inclined to be cross. She sang, too, to an old cracked piano, which I think had been a spinet in its youth. Miss Jessie sang, \u201cJock of Hazeldean\u201d a little out of tune; but we were none of us musical, though Miss Jenkyns beat time, out of time, by way of appearing to be so.\n\nIt was very good of Miss Jenkyns to do this; for I had seen that, a little before, she had been a good deal annoyed by Miss Jessie Brown\u2019s unguarded admission (\xe0 propos of Shetland wool) that she had an uncle, her mother\u2019s brother, who was a shopkeeper in Edinburgh. Miss Jenkyns tried to drown this confession by a terrible cough\u2014for the Honourable Mrs Jamieson was sitting at a card-table nearest Miss Jessie, and what would she say or think if she found out she was in the same room with a shop-keeper\u2019s niece! But Miss Jessie Brown (who had no tact, as we all agreed the next morning) would repeat the information, and assure Miss Pole she could easily get her the identical Shetland wool required, \u201cthrough my uncle, who has the best assortment of Shetland goods of any one in Edinbro\u2019.\u201d It was to take the taste of this out of our mouths, and the sound of this out of our ears, that Miss Jenkyns proposed music; so I say again, it was very good of her to beat time to the song.\n\nWhen the trays re-appeared with biscuits and wine, punctually at a quarter to nine, there was conversation, comparing of cards, and talking over tricks; but by-and-by Captain Brown sported a bit of literature.\n\n\u201cHave you seen any numbers of \u2018The Pickwick Papers\u2019?\u201d said he. (They were then publishing in parts.) \u201cCapital thing!\u201d\n\nNow Miss Jenkyns was daughter of a deceased rector of Cranford; and, on the strength of a number of manuscript sermons, and a pretty good library of divinity, considered herself literary, and looked upon any conversation about books as a challenge to her. So she answered and said, \u201cYes, she had seen them; indeed, she might say she had read them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what do you think of them?\u201d exclaimed Captain Brown. \u201cAren\u2019t they famously good?\u201d\n\nSo urged Miss Jenkyns could not but speak.\n\n\u201cI must say, I don\u2019t think they are by any means equal to Dr Johnson. Still, perhaps, the author is young. Let him persevere, and who knows what he may become if he will take the great Doctor for his model?\u201d This was evidently too much for Captain Brown to take placidly; and I saw the words on the tip of his tongue before Miss Jenkyns had finished her sentence.\n\n\u201cIt is quite a different sort of thing, my dear madam,\u201d he began.\n\n\u201cI am quite aware of that,\u201d returned she. \u201cAnd I make allowances, Captain Brown.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust allow me to read you a scene out of this month\u2019s number,\u201d pleaded he. \u201cI had it only this morning, and I don\u2019t think the company can have read it yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you please,\u201d said she, settling herself with an air of resignation. He read the account of the \u201cswarry\u201d which Sam Weller gave at Bath. Some of us laughed heartily. I did not dare, because I was staying in the house. Miss Jenkyns sat in patient gravity. When it was ended, she turned to me, and said with mild dignity\u2014\n\n\u201cFetch me \u2018Rasselas,\u2019 my dear, out of the book-room.\u201d\n\nWhen I had brought it to her, she turned to Captain Brown\u2014\n\n\u201cNow allow me to read you a scene, and then the present company can judge between your favourite, Mr Boz, and Dr Johnson.\u201d\n\nShe read one of the conversations between Rasselas and Imlac, in a high-pitched, majestic voice: and when she had ended, she said, \u201cI imagine I am now justified in my preference of Dr Johnson as a writer of fiction.\u201d The Captain screwed his lips up, and drummed on the table, but he did not speak. She thought she would give him a finishing blow or two.\n\nEndeavouring to beguile her into conversation\n\n\u201cI consider it vulgar, and below the dignity of literature, to publish in numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow was the Rambler published, ma\u2019am?\u201d asked Captain Brown in a low voice, which I think Miss Jenkyns could not have heard.\n\n\u201cDr Johnson\u2019s style is a model for young beginners. My father recommended it to me when I began to write letters\u2014I have formed my own style upon it; I recommended it to your favourite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should be very sorry for him to exchange his style for any such pompous writing,\u201d said Captain Brown.\n\nMiss Jenkyns felt this as a personal affront, in a way of which the Captain had not dreamed. Epistolary writing she and her friends considered as her forte. Many a copy of many a letter have I seen written and corrected on the slate, before she \u201cseized the half-hour just previous to post-time to assure\u201d her friends of this or of that; and Dr Johnson was, as she said, her model in these compositions. She drew herself up with dignity, and only replied to Captain Brown\u2019s last remark by saying, with marked emphasis on every syllable, \u201cI prefer Dr Johnson to Mr Boz.\u201d\n\nIt is said\u2014I won\u2019t vouch for the fact\u2014that Captain Brown was heard to say, sotto voce, \u201cD-n Dr Johnson!\u201d If he did, he was penitent afterwards, as he showed by going to stand near Miss Jenkyns\u2019 arm-chair, and endeavouring to beguile her into conversation on some more pleasing subject. But she was inexorable. The next day she made the remark I have mentioned about Miss Jessie\u2019s dimples.\nCHAPTER II.\nTHE CAPTAIN\n\nIt was impossible to live a month at Cranford and not know the daily habits of each resident; and long before my visit was ended I knew much concerning the whole Brown trio. There was nothing new to be discovered respecting their poverty; for they had spoken simply and openly about that from the very first. They made no mystery of the necessity for their being economical. All that remained to be discovered was the Captain\u2019s infinite kindness of heart, and the various modes in which, unconsciously to himself, he manifested it. Some little anecdotes were talked about for some time after they occurred. As we did not read much, and as all the ladies were pretty well suited with servants, there was a dearth of subjects for conversation. We therefore discussed the circumstance of the Captain taking a poor old woman\u2019s dinner out of her hands one very slippery Sunday. He had met her returning from the bakehouse as he came from church, and noticed her precarious footing; and, with the grave dignity with which he did everything, he relieved her of her burden, and steered along the street by her side, carrying her baked mutton and potatoes safely home. This was thought very eccentric; and it was rather expected that he would pay a round of calls, on the Monday morning, to explain and apologise to the Cranford sense of propriety: but he did no such thing: and then it was decided that he was ashamed, and was keeping out of sight. In a kindly pity for him, we began to say, \u201cAfter all, the Sunday morning\u2019s occurrence showed great goodness of heart,\u201d and it was resolved that he should be comforted on his next appearance amongst us; but, lo! he came down upon us, untouched by any sense of shame, speaking loud and bass as ever, his head thrown back, his wig as jaunty and well-curled as usual, and we were obliged to conclude he had forgotten all about Sunday.\n\nMiss Pole and Miss Jessie Brown had set up a kind of intimacy on the strength of the Shetland wool and the new knitting stitches; so it happened that when I went to visit Miss Pole I saw more of the Browns than I had done while staying with Miss Jenkyns, who had never got over what she called Captain Brown\u2019s disparaging remarks upon Dr Johnson as a writer of light and agreeable fiction. I found that Miss Brown was seriously ill of some lingering, incurable complaint, the pain occasioned by which gave the uneasy expression to her face that I had taken for unmitigated crossness. Cross, too, she was at times, when the nervous irritability occasioned by her disease became past endurance. Miss Jessie bore with her at these times, even more patiently than she did with the bitter self-upbraidings by which they were invariably succeeded. Miss Brown used to accuse herself, not merely of hasty and irritable temper, but also of being the cause why her father and sister were obliged to pinch, in order to allow her the small luxuries which were necessaries in her condition. She would so fain have made sacrifices for them, and have lightened their cares, that the original generosity of her disposition added acerbity to her temper. All this was borne by Miss Jessie and her father with more than placidity\u2014with absolute tenderness. I forgave Miss Jessie her singing out of tune, and her juvenility of dress, when I saw her at home. I came to perceive that Captain Brown\u2019s dark Brutus wig and padded coat (alas! too often threadbare) were remnants of the military smartness of his youth, which he now wore unconsciously. He was a man of infinite resources, gained in his barrack experience. As he confessed, no one could black his boots to please him except himself; but, indeed, he was not above saving the little maid-servant\u2019s labours in every way\u2014knowing, most likely, that his daughter\u2019s illness made the place a hard one.\n\nHe endeavoured to make peace with Miss Jenkyns soon after the memorable dispute I have named, by a present of a wooden fire-shovel (his own making), having heard her say how much the grating of an iron one annoyed her. She received the present with cool gratitude, and thanked him formally. When he was gone, she bade me put it away in the lumber-room; feeling, probably, that no present from a man who preferred Mr Boz to Dr Johnson could be less jarring than an iron fire-shovel.\n\nSuch was the state of things when I left Cranford and went to Drumble. I had, however, several correspondents, who kept me au fait as to the proceedings of the dear little town. There was Miss Pole, who was becoming as much absorbed in crochet as she had been once in knitting, and the burden of whose letter was something like, \u201cBut don\u2019t you forget the white worsted at Flint\u2019s\u201d of the old song; for at the end of every sentence of news came a fresh direction as to some crochet commission which I was to execute for her. Miss Matilda Jenkyns (who did not mind being called Miss Matty, when Miss Jenkyns was not by) wrote nice, kind, rambling letters, now and then venturing into an opinion of her own; but suddenly pulling herself up, and either begging me not to name what she had said, as Deborah thought differently, and she knew, or else putting in a postscript to the effect that, since writing the above, she had been talking over the subject with Deborah, and was quite convinced that, etc.\u2014(here probably followed a recantation of every opinion she had given in the letter). Then came Miss Jenkyns\u2014Deborah, as she liked Miss Matty to call her, her father having once said that the Hebrew name ought to be so pronounced. I secretly think she took the Hebrew prophetess for a model in character; and, indeed, she was not unlike the stern prophetess in some ways, making allowance, of course, for modern customs and difference in dress. Miss Jenkyns wore a cravat, and a little bonnet like a jockey-cap, and altogether had the appearance of a strong-minded woman; although she would have despised the modern idea of women being equal to men. Equal, indeed! she knew they were superior. But to return to her letters. Everything in them was stately and grand like herself. I have been looking them over (dear Miss Jenkyns, how I honoured her!) and I will give an extract, more especially because it relates to our friend Captain Brown:\u2014\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Mrs Jamieson has only just quitted me; and, in the course of conversation, she communicated to me the intelligence that she had yesterday received a call from her revered husband\u2019s quondam friend, Lord Mauleverer. You will not easily conjecture what brought his lordship within the precincts of our little town. It was to see Captain Brown, with whom, it appears, his lordship was acquainted in the \u2018plumed wars,\u2019 and who had the privilege of averting destruction from his lordship\u2019s head when some great peril was impending over it, off the misnomered Cape of Good Hope. You know our friend the Honourable Mrs Jamieson\u2019s deficiency in the spirit of innocent curiosity, and you will therefore not be so much surprised when I tell you she was quite unable to disclose to me the exact nature of the peril in question. I was anxious, I confess, to ascertain in what manner Captain Brown, with his limited establishment, could receive so distinguished a guest; and I discovered that his lordship retired to rest, and, let us hope, to refreshing slumbers, at the Angel Hotel; but shared the Brunonian meals during the two days that he honoured Cranford with his august presence. Mrs Johnson, our civil butcher\u2019s wife, informs me that Miss Jessie purchased a leg of lamb; but, besides this, I can hear of no preparation whatever to give a suitable reception to so distinguished a visitor. Perhaps they entertained him with \u2018the feast of reason and the flow of soul\u2019; and to us, who are acquainted with Captain Brown\u2019s sad want of relish for \u2018the pure wells of English undefiled,\u2019 it may be matter for congratulation that he has had the opportunity of improving his taste by holding converse with an elegant and refined member of the British aristocracy. But from some mundane failings who is altogether free?\u201d\n\nMiss Pole and Miss Matty wrote to me by the same post. Such a piece of news as Lord Mauleverer\u2019s visit was not to be lost on the Cranford letter-writers: they made the most of it. Miss Matty humbly apologised for writing at the same time as her sister, who was so much more capable than she to describe the honour done to Cranford; but in spite of a little bad spelling, Miss Matty\u2019s account gave me the best idea of the commotion occasioned by his lordship\u2019s visit, after it had occurred; for, except the people at the Angel, the Browns, Mrs Jamieson, and a little lad his lordship had sworn at for driving a dirty hoop against the aristocratic legs, I could not hear of any one with whom his lordship had held conversation.\n\nMy next visit to Cranford was in the summer. There had been neither births, deaths, nor marriages since I was there last. Everybody lived in the same house, and wore pretty nearly the same well-preserved, old-fashioned clothes. The greatest event was, that Miss Jenkyns had purchased a new carpet for the drawing-room. Oh, the busy work Miss Matty and I had in chasing the sunbeams, as they fell in an afternoon right down on this carpet through the blindless window! We spread newspapers over the places and sat down to our book or our work; and, lo! in a quarter of an hour the sun had moved, and was blazing away on a fresh spot; and down again we went on our knees to alter the position of the newspapers. We were very busy, too, one whole morning, before Miss Jenkyns gave her party, in following her directions, and in cutting out and stitching together pieces of newspaper so as to form little paths to every chair set for the expected visitors, lest their shoes might dirty or defile the purity of the carpet. Do you make paper paths for every guest to walk upon in London?\n\nCaptain Brown and Miss Jenkyns were not very cordial to each other. The literary dispute, of which I had seen the beginning, was a \u201craw,\u201d the slightest touch on which made them wince. It was the only difference of opinion they had ever had; but that difference was enough. Miss Jenkyns could not refrain from talking at Captain Brown; and, though he did not reply, he drummed with his fingers, which action she felt and resented as very disparaging to Dr Johnson. He was rather ostentatious in his preference of the writings of Mr Boz; would walk through the streets so absorbed in them that he all but ran against Miss Jenkyns; and though his apologies were earnest and sincere, and though he did not, in fact, do more than startle her and himself, she owned to me she had rather he had knocked her down, if he had only been reading a higher style of literature. The poor, brave Captain! he looked older, and more worn, and his clothes were very threadbare. But he seemed as bright and cheerful as ever, unless he was asked about his daughter\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cShe suffers a great deal, and she must suffer more: we do what we can to alleviate her pain;\u2014God\u2019s will be done!\u201d He took off his hat at these last words. I found, from Miss Matty, that everything had been done, in fact. A medical man, of high repute in that country neighbourhood, had been sent for, and every injunction he had given was attended to, regardless of expense. Miss Matty was sure they denied themselves many things in order to make the invalid comfortable; but they never spoke about it; and as for Miss Jessie!\u2014\u201cI really think she\u2019s an angel,\u201d said poor Miss Matty, quite overcome. \u201cTo see her way of bearing with Miss Brown\u2019s crossness, and the bright face she puts on after she\u2019s been sitting up a whole night and scolded above half of it, is quite beautiful. Yet she looks as neat and as ready to welcome the Captain at breakfast-time as if she had been asleep in the Queen\u2019s bed all night. My dear! you could never laugh at her prim little curls or her pink bows again if you saw her as I have done.\u201d I could only feel very penitent, and greet Miss Jessie with double respect when I met her next. She looked faded and pinched; and her lips began to quiver, as if she was very weak, when she spoke of her sister. But she brightened, and sent back the tears that were glittering in her pretty eyes, as she said\u2014\n\n\u201cBut, to be sure, what a town Cranford is for kindness! I don\u2019t suppose any one has a better dinner than usual cooked but the best part of all comes in a little covered basin for my sister. The poor people will leave their earliest vegetables at our door for her. They speak short and gruff, as if they were ashamed of it: but I am sure it often goes to my heart to see their thoughtfulness.\u201d The tears now came back and overflowed; but after a minute or two she began to scold herself, and ended by going away the same cheerful Miss Jessie as ever.\n\n\u201cBut why does not this Lord Mauleverer do something for the man who saved his life?\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cWhy, you see, unless Captain Brown has some reason for it, he never speaks about being poor; and he walked along by his lordship looking as happy and cheerful as a prince; and as they never called attention to their dinner by apologies, and as Miss Brown was better that day, and all seemed bright, I daresay his lordship never knew how much care there was in the background. He did send game in the winter pretty often, but now he is gone abroad.\u201d\n\nI had often occasion to notice the use that was made of fragments and small opportunities in Cranford; the rose-leaves that were gathered ere they fell to make into a potpourri for someone who had no garden; the little bundles of lavender flowers sent to strew the drawers of some town-dweller, or to burn in the chamber of some invalid. Things that many would despise, and actions which it seemed scarcely worth while to perform, were all attended to in Cranford. Miss Jenkyns stuck an apple full of cloves, to be heated and smell pleasantly in Miss Brown\u2019s room; and as she put in each clove she uttered a Johnsonian sentence. Indeed, she never could think of the Browns without talking Johnson; and, as they were seldom absent from her thoughts just then, I heard many a rolling, three-piled sentence.\n\nCaptain Brown called one day to thank Miss Jenkyns for many little kindnesses, which I did not know until then that she had rendered. He had suddenly become like an old man; his deep bass voice had a quavering in it, his eyes looked dim, and the lines on his face were deep. He did not\u2014could not\u2014speak cheerfully of his daughter\u2019s state, but he talked with manly, pious resignation, and not much. Twice over he said, \u201cWhat Jessie has been to us, God only knows!\u201d and after the second time, he got up hastily, shook hands all round without speaking, and left the room.\n\nThat afternoon we perceived little groups in the street, all listening with faces aghast to some tale or other. Miss Jenkyns wondered what could be the matter for some time before she took the undignified step of sending Jenny out to inquire.\n\nJenny came back with a white face of terror. \u201cOh, ma\u2019am! Oh, Miss Jenkyns, ma\u2019am! Captain Brown is killed by them nasty cruel railroads!\u201d and she burst into tears. She, along with many others, had experienced the poor Captain\u2019s kindness.\n\n\u201cHow?\u2014where\u2014where? Good God! Jenny, don\u2019t waste time in crying, but tell us something.\u201d Miss Matty rushed out into the street at once, and collared the man who was telling the tale.\n\nShe brought the affrighted carter ... into the drawing-room\n\n\u201cCome in\u2014come to my sister at once, Miss Jenkyns, the rector\u2019s daughter. Oh, man, man! say it is not true,\u201d she cried, as she brought the affrighted carter, sleeking down his hair, into the drawing-room, where he stood with his wet boots on the new carpet, and no one regarded it.\n\n\u201cPlease, mum, it is true. I seed it myself,\u201d and he shuddered at the recollection. \u201cThe Captain was a-reading some new book as he was deep in, a-waiting for the down train; and there was a little lass as wanted to come to its mammy, and gave its sister the slip, and came toddling across the line. And he looked up sudden, at the sound of the train coming, and seed the child, and he darted on the line and cotched it up, and his foot slipped, and the train came over him in no time. O Lord, Lord! Mum, it\u2019s quite true, and they\u2019ve come over to tell his daughters. The child\u2019s safe, though, with only a bang on its shoulder as he threw it to its mammy. Poor Captain would be glad of that, mum, wouldn\u2019t he? God bless him!\u201d The great rough carter puckered up his manly face, and turned away to hide his tears. I turned to Miss Jenkyns. She looked very ill, as if she were going to faint, and signed to me to open the window.\n\n\u201cMatilda, bring me my bonnet. I must go to those girls. God pardon me, if ever I have spoken contemptuously to the Captain!\u201d\n\nMiss Jenkyns arrayed herself to go out, telling Miss Matilda to give the man a glass of wine. While she was away, Miss Matty and I huddled over the fire, talking in a low and awestruck voice. I know we cried quietly all the time.\n\nMiss Jenkyns came home in a silent mood, and we durst not ask her many questions. She told us that Miss Jessie had fainted, and that she and Miss Pole had had some difficulty in bringing her round; but that, as soon as she recovered, she begged one of them to go and sit with her sister.\n\n\u201cMr Hoggins says she cannot live many days, and she shall be spared this shock,\u201d said Miss Jessie, shivering with feelings to which she dared not give way.\n\n\u201cBut how can you manage, my dear?\u201d asked Miss Jenkyns; \u201cyou cannot bear up, she must see your tears.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod will help me\u2014I will not give way\u2014she was asleep when the news came; she may be asleep yet. She would be so utterly miserable, not merely at my father\u2019s death, but to think of what would become of me; she is so good to me.\u201d She looked up earnestly in their faces with her soft true eyes, and Miss Pole told Miss Jenkyns afterwards she could hardly bear it, knowing, as she did, how Miss Brown treated her sister.\n\nHowever, it was settled according to Miss Jessie\u2019s wish. Miss Brown was to be told her father had been summoned to take a short journey on railway business. They had managed it in some way\u2014Miss Jenkyns could not exactly say how. Miss Pole was to stop with Miss Jessie. Mrs Jamieson had sent to inquire. And this was all we heard that night; and a sorrowful night it was. The next day a full account of the fatal accident was in the county paper which Miss Jenkyns took in. Her eyes were very weak, she said, and she asked me to read it. When I came to the \u201cgallant gentleman was deeply engaged in the perusal of a number of \u2018Pickwick,\u2019 which he had just received,\u201d Miss Jenkyns shook her head long and solemnly, and then sighed out, \u201cPoor, dear, infatuated man!\u201d\n\nThe corpse was to be taken from the station to the parish church, there to be interred. Miss Jessie had set her heart on following it to the grave; and no dissuasives could alter her resolve. Her restraint upon herself made her almost obstinate; she resisted all Miss Pole\u2019s entreaties and Miss Jenkyns\u2019 advice. At last Miss Jenkyns gave up the point; and after a silence, which I feared portended some deep displeasure against Miss Jessie, Miss Jenkyns said she should accompany the latter to the funeral.\n\n\u201cIt is not fit for you to go alone. It would be against both propriety and humanity were I to allow it.\u201d\n\nMiss Jessie seemed as if she did not half like this arrangement; but her obstinacy, if she had any, had been exhausted in her determination to go to the interment. She longed, poor thing, I have no doubt, to cry alone over the grave of the dear father to whom she had been all in all, and to give way, for one little half-hour, uninterrupted by sympathy and unobserved by friendship. But it was not to be. That afternoon Miss Jenkyns sent out for a yard of black crape, and employed herself busily in trimming the little black silk bonnet I have spoken about. When it was finished she put it on, and looked at us for approbation\u2014admiration she despised. I was full of sorrow, but, by one of those whimsical thoughts which come unbidden into our heads, in times of deepest grief, I no sooner saw the bonnet than I was reminded of a helmet; and in that hybrid bonnet, half helmet, half jockey-cap, did Miss Jenkyns attend Captain Brown\u2019s funeral, and, I believe, supported Miss Jessie with a tender, indulgent firmness which was invaluable, allowing her to weep her passionate fill before they left.\n\nMiss Pole, Miss Matty, and I, meanwhile attended to Miss Brown: and hard work we found it to relieve her querulous and never-ending complaints. But if we were so weary and dispirited, what must Miss Jessie have been! Yet she came back almost calm as if she had gained a new strength. She put off her mourning dress, and came in, looking pale and gentle, thanking us each with a soft long pressure of the hand. She could even smile\u2014a faint, sweet, wintry smile\u2014as if to reassure us of her power to endure; but her look made our eyes fill suddenly with tears, more than if she had cried outright.\n\nIt was settled that Miss Pole was to remain with her all the watching livelong night; and that Miss Matty and I were to return in the morning to relieve them, and give Miss Jessie the opportunity for a few hours of sleep. But when the morning came, Miss Jenkyns appeared at the breakfast-table, equipped in her helmet-bonnet, and ordered Miss Matty to stay at home, as she meant to go and help to nurse. She was evidently in a state of great friendly excitement, which she showed by eating her breakfast standing, and scolding the household all round.\n\nNo nursing\u2014no energetic strong-minded woman could help Miss Brown now. There was that in the room as we entered which was stronger than us all, and made us shrink into solemn awestruck helplessness. Miss Brown was dying. We hardly knew her voice, it was so devoid of the complaining tone we had always associated with it. Miss Jessie told me afterwards that it, and her face too, were just what they had been formerly, when her mother\u2019s death left her the young anxious head of the family, of whom only Miss Jessie survived.\n\nShe was conscious of her sister\u2019s presence, though not, I think, of ours. We stood a little behind the curtain: Miss Jessie knelt with her face near her sister\u2019s, in order to catch the last soft awful whispers.\n\n\u201cOh, Jessie! Jessie! How selfish I have been! God forgive me for letting you sacrifice yourself for me as you did! I have so loved you\u2014and yet I have thought only of myself. God forgive me!\u201d\n\n\u201cHush, love! hush!\u201d said Miss Jessie, sobbing.\n\n\u201cAnd my father, my dear, dear father! I will not complain now, if God will give me strength to be patient. But, oh, Jessie! tell my father how I longed and yearned to see him at last, and to ask his forgiveness. He can never know now how I loved him\u2014oh! if I might but tell him, before I die! What a life of sorrow his has been, and I have done so little to cheer him!\u201d\n\nA light came into Miss Jessie\u2019s face. \u201cWould it comfort you, dearest, to think that he does know?\u2014would it comfort you, love, to know that his cares, his sorrows\u201d\u2014Her voice quivered, but she steadied it into calmness\u2014\u201cMary! he has gone before you to the place where the weary are at rest. He knows now how you loved him.\u201d\n\nA strange look, which was not distress, came over Miss Brown\u2019s face. She did not speak for some time, but then we saw her lips form the words, rather than heard the sound\u2014\u201cFather, mother, Harry, Archy;\u201d\u2014then, as if it were a new idea throwing a filmy shadow over her darkened mind\u2014\u201cBut you will be alone, Jessie!\u201d\n\nMiss Jessie had been feeling this all during the silence, I think; for the tears rolled down her cheeks like rain, at these words, and she could not answer at first. Then she put her hands together tight, and lifted them up, and said\u2014but not to us\u2014\u201cThough He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.\u201d\n\nIn a few moments more Miss Brown lay calm and still\u2014never to sorrow or murmur more.\n\nAfter this second funeral, Miss Jenkyns insisted that Miss Jessie should come to stay with her rather than go back to the desolate house, which, in fact, we learned from Miss Jessie, must now be given up, as she had not wherewithal to maintain it. She had something above twenty pounds a year, besides the interest of the money for which the furniture would sell; but she could not live upon that: and so we talked over her qualifications for earning money.\n\n\u201cI can sew neatly,\u201d said she, \u201cand I like nursing. I think, too, I could manage a house, if any one would try me as housekeeper; or I would go into a shop as saleswoman, if they would have patience with me at first.\u201d\n\nMiss Jenkyns declared, in an angry voice, that she should do no such thing; and talked to herself about \u201csome people having no idea of their rank as a captain\u2019s daughter,\u201d nearly an hour afterwards, when she brought Miss Jessie up a basin of delicately-made arrowroot, and stood over her like a dragoon until the last spoonful was finished: then she disappeared. Miss Jessie began to tell me some more of the plans which had suggested themselves to her, and insensibly fell into talking of the days that were past and gone, and interested me so much I neither knew nor heeded how time passed. We were both startled when Miss Jenkyns reappeared, and caught us crying. I was afraid lest she would be displeased, as she often said that crying hindered digestion, and I knew she wanted Miss Jessie to get strong; but, instead, she looked queer and excited, and fidgeted round us without saying anything. At last she spoke.\n\n\u201cI have been so much startled\u2014no, I\u2019ve not been at all startled\u2014don\u2019t mind me, my dear Miss Jessie\u2014I\u2019ve been very much surprised\u2014in fact, I\u2019ve had a caller, whom you knew once, my dear Miss Jessie\u201d\u2014\n\nMiss Jessie went very white, then flushed scarlet, and looked eagerly at Miss Jenkyns.\n\n\u201cA gentleman, my dear, who wants to know if you would see him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it?\u2014it is not\u201d\u2014stammered out Miss Jessie\u2014and got no farther.\n\n\u201cThis is his card,\u201d said Miss Jenkyns, giving it to Miss Jessie; and while her head was bent over it, Miss Jenkyns went through a series of winks and odd faces to me, and formed her lips into a long sentence, of which, of course, I could not understand a word.\n\n\u201cMay he come up?\u201d asked Miss Jenkyns at last.\n\n\u201cOh, yes! certainly!\u201d said Miss Jessie, as much as to say, this is your house, you may show any visitor where you like. She took up some knitting of Miss Matty\u2019s and began to be very busy, though I could see how she trembled all over.\n\nMiss Jenkyns rang the bell, and told the servant who answered it to show Major Gordon upstairs; and, presently, in walked a tall, fine, frank-looking man of forty or upwards. He shook hands with Miss Jessie; but he could not see her eyes, she kept them so fixed on the ground. Miss Jenkyns asked me if I would come and help her to tie up the preserves in the store-room; and though Miss Jessie plucked at my gown, and even looked up at me with begging eye, I durst not refuse to go where Miss Jenkyns asked. Instead of tying up preserves in the store-room, however, we went to talk in the dining-room; and there Miss Jenkyns told me what Major Gordon had told her; how he had served in the same regiment with Captain Brown, and had become acquainted with Miss Jessie, then a sweet-looking, blooming girl of eighteen; how the acquaintance had grown into love on his part, though it had been some years before he had spoken; how, on becoming possessed, through the will of an uncle, of a good estate in Scotland, he had offered and been refused, though with so much agitation and evident distress that he was sure she was not indifferent to him; and how he had discovered that the obstacle was the fell disease which was, even then, too surely threatening her sister. She had mentioned that the surgeons foretold intense suffering; and there was no one but herself to nurse her poor Mary, or cheer and comfort her father during the time of illness. They had had long discussions; and on her refusal to pledge herself to him as his wife when all should be over, he had grown angry, and broken off entirely, and gone abroad, believing that she was a cold-hearted person whom he would do well to forget. He had been travelling in the East, and was on his return home when, at Rome, he saw the account of Captain Brown\u2019s death in Galignani.\n\nJust then Miss Matty, who had been out all the morning, and had only lately returned to the house, burst in with a face of dismay and outraged propriety.\n\n\u201cOh, goodness me!\u201d she said. \u201cDeborah, there\u2019s a gentleman sitting in the drawing-room with his arm round Miss Jessie\u2019s waist!\u201d Miss Matty\u2019s eyes looked large with terror.\n\n\u201cWith his arm around Miss Jessie\u2019s waist!\u201d\n\nMiss Jenkyns snubbed her down in an instant.\n\n\u201cThe most proper place in the world for his arm to be in. Go away, Matilda, and mind your own business.\u201d This from her sister, who had hitherto been a model of feminine decorum, was a blow for poor Miss Matty, and with a double shock she left the room.\n\nThe last time I ever saw poor Miss Jenkyns was many years after this. Mrs Gordon had kept up a warm and affectionate intercourse with all at Cranford. Miss Jenkyns, Miss Matty, and Miss Pole had all been to visit her, and returned with wonderful accounts of her house, her husband, her dress, and her looks. For, with happiness, something of her early bloom returned; she had been a year or two younger than we had taken her for. Her eyes were always lovely, and, as Mrs Gordon, her dimples were not out of place. At the time to which I have referred, when I last saw Miss Jenkyns, that lady was old and feeble, and had lost something of her strong mind. Little Flora Gordon was staying with the Misses Jenkyns, and when I came in she was reading aloud to Miss Jenkyns, who lay feeble and changed on the sofa. Flora put down the Rambler when I came in.\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Miss Jenkyns, \u201cyou find me changed, my dear. I can\u2019t see as I used to do. If Flora were not here to read to me, I hardly know how I should get through the day. Did you ever read the Rambler? It\u2019s a wonderful book\u2014wonderful! and the most improving reading for Flora\u201d (which I daresay it would have been, if she could have read half the words without spelling, and could have understood the meaning of a third), \u201cbetter than that strange old book, with the queer name, poor Captain Brown was killed for reading\u2014that book by Mr Boz, you know\u2014\u2018Old Poz\u2019; when I was a girl\u2014but that\u2019s a long time ago\u2014I acted Lucy in \u2018Old Poz.\u2019\u201d She babbled on long enough for Flora to get a good long spell at the \u201cChristmas Carol,\u201d which Miss Matty had left on the table.\nCHAPTER III.\nA LOVE AFFAIR OF LONG AGO\n\nI thought that probably my connection with Cranford would cease after Miss Jenkyns\u2019s death; at least, that it would have to be kept up by correspondence, which bears much the same relation to personal intercourse that the books of dried plants I sometimes see (\u201cHortus Siccus,\u201d I think they call the thing) do to the living and fresh flowers in the lanes and meadows. I was pleasantly surprised, therefore, by receiving a letter from Miss Pole (who had always come in for a supplementary week after my annual visit to Miss Jenkyns) proposing that I should go and stay with her; and then, in a couple of days after my acceptance, came a note from Miss Matty, in which, in a rather circuitous and very humble manner, she told me how much pleasure I should confer if I could spend a week or two with her, either before or after I had been at Miss Pole\u2019s; \u201cfor,\u201d she said, \u201csince my dear sister\u2019s death I am well aware I have no attractions to offer; it is only to the kindness of my friends that I can owe their company.\u201d\n\nOf course I promised to come to dear Miss Matty as soon as I had ended my visit to Miss Pole; and the day after my arrival at Cranford I went to see her, much wondering what the house would be like without Miss Jenkyns, and rather dreading the changed aspect of things. Miss Matty began to cry as soon as she saw me. She was evidently nervous from having anticipated my call. I comforted her as well as I could; and I found the best consolation I could give was the honest praise that came from my heart as I spoke of the deceased. Miss Matty slowly shook her head over each virtue as it was named and attributed to her sister; and at last she could not restrain the tears which had long been silently flowing, but hid her face behind her handkerchief and sobbed aloud.\n\n\u201cDear Miss Matty,\u201d said I, taking her hand\u2014for indeed I did not know in what way to tell her how sorry I was for her, left deserted in the world. She put down her handkerchief and said\u2014\n\n\u201cMy dear, I\u2019d rather you did not call me Matty. She did not like it; but I did many a thing she did not like, I\u2019m afraid\u2014and now she\u2019s gone! If you please, my love, will you call me Matilda?\u201d\n\nI promised faithfully, and began to practise the new name with Miss Pole that very day; and, by degrees, Miss Matilda\u2019s feeling on the subject was known through Cranford, and we all tried to drop the more familiar name, but with so little success that by-and-by we gave up the attempt.\n\nMy visit to Miss Pole was very quiet. Miss Jenkyns had so long taken the lead in Cranford that now she was gone, they hardly knew how to give a party. The Honourable Mrs Jamieson, to whom Miss Jenkyns herself had always yielded the post of honour, was fat and inert, and very much at the mercy of her old servants. If they chose that she should give a party, they reminded her of the necessity for so doing: if not, she let it alone. There was all the more time for me to hear old-world stories from Miss Pole, while she sat knitting, and I making my father\u2019s shirts. I always took a quantity of plain sewing to Cranford; for, as we did not read much, or walk much, I found it a capital time to get through my work. One of Miss Pole\u2019s stories related to a shadow of a love affair that was dimly perceived or suspected long years before.\n\nPresently, the time arrived when I was to remove to Miss Matilda\u2019s house. I found her timid and anxious about the arrangements for my comfort. Many a time, while I was unpacking, did she come backwards and forwards to stir the fire which burned all the worse for being so frequently poked.\n\n\u201cHave you drawers enough, dear?\u201d asked she. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly how my sister used to arrange them. She had capital methods. I am sure she would have trained a servant in a week to make a better fire than this, and Fanny has been with me four months.\u201d\n\nThis subject of servants was a standing grievance, and I could not wonder much at it; for if gentlemen were scarce, and almost unheard of in the \u201cgenteel society\u201d of Cranford, they or their counterparts\u2014handsome young men\u2014abounded in the lower classes. The pretty neat servant-maids had their choice of desirable \u201cfollowers\u201d; and their mistresses, without having the sort of mysterious dread of men and matrimony that Miss Matilda had, might well feel a little anxious lest the heads of their comely maids should be turned by the joiner, or the butcher, or the gardener, who were obliged, by their callings, to come to the house, and who, as ill-luck would have it, were generally handsome and unmarried. Fanny\u2019s lovers, if she had any\u2014and Miss Matilda suspected her of so many flirtations that, if she had not been very pretty, I should have doubted her having one\u2014were a constant anxiety to her mistress. She was forbidden, by the articles of her engagement, to have \u201cfollowers\u201d; and though she had answered, innocently enough, doubling up the hem of her apron as she spoke, \u201cPlease, ma\u2019am, I never had more than one at a time,\u201d Miss Matty prohibited that one. But a vision of a man seemed to haunt the kitchen. Fanny assured me that it was all fancy, or else I should have said myself that I had seen a man\u2019s coat-tails whisk into the scullery once, when I went on an errand into the store-room at night; and another evening, when, our watches having stopped, I went to look at the clock, there was a very odd appearance, singularly like a young man squeezed up between the clock and the back of the open kitchen door: and I thought Fanny snatched up the candle very hastily, so as to throw the shadow on the clock face, while she very positively told me the time half-an-hour too early, as we found out afterwards by the church clock. But I did not add to Miss Matty\u2019s anxieties by naming my suspicions, especially as Fanny said to me, the next day, that it was such a queer kitchen for having odd shadows about it, she really was almost afraid to stay; \u201cfor you know, miss,\u201d she added, \u201cI don\u2019t see a creature from six o\u2019clock tea, till Missus rings the bell for prayers at ten.\u201d\n\nHowever, it so fell out that Fanny had to leave and Miss Matilda begged me to stay and \u201csettle her\u201d with the new maid; to which I consented, after I had heard from my father that he did not want me at home. The new servant was a rough, honest-looking, country girl, who had only lived in a farm place before; but I liked her looks when she came to be hired; and I promised Miss Matilda to put her in the ways of the house. The said ways were religiously such as Miss Matilda thought her sister would approve. Many a domestic rule and regulation had been a subject of plaintive whispered murmur to me during Miss Jenkyns\u2019s life; but now that she was gone, I do not think that even I, who was a favourite, durst have suggested an alteration. To give an instance: we constantly adhered to the forms which were observed, at meal-times, in \u201cmy father, the rector\u2019s house.\u201d Accordingly, we had always wine and dessert; but the decanters were only filled when there was a party, and what remained was seldom touched, though we had two wine-glasses apiece every day after dinner, until the next festive occasion arrived, when the state of the remainder wine was examined into in a family council. The dregs were often given to the poor: but occasionally, when a good deal had been left at the last party (five months ago, it might be), it was added to some of a fresh bottle, brought up from the cellar. I fancy poor Captain Brown did not much like wine, for I noticed he never finished his first glass, and most military men take several. Then, as to our dessert, Miss Jenkyns used to gather currants and gooseberries for it herself, which I sometimes thought would have tasted better fresh from the trees; but then, as Miss Jenkyns observed, there would have been nothing for dessert in summer-time. As it was, we felt very genteel with our two glasses apiece, and a dish of gooseberries at the top, of currants and biscuits at the sides, and two decanters at the bottom. When oranges came in, a curious proceeding was gone through. Miss Jenkyns did not like to cut the fruit; for, as she observed, the juice all ran out nobody knew where; sucking (only I think she used some more recondite word) was in fact the only way of enjoying oranges; but then there was the unpleasant association with a ceremony frequently gone through by little babies; and so, after dessert, in orange season, Miss Jenkyns and Miss Matty used to rise up, possess themselves each of an orange in silence, and withdraw to the privacy of their own rooms to indulge in sucking oranges.\n\nI had once or twice tried, on such occasions, to prevail on Miss Matty to stay, and had succeeded in her sister\u2019s lifetime. I held up a screen, and did not look, and, as she said, she tried not to make the noise very offensive; but now that she was left alone, she seemed quite horrified when I begged her to remain with me in the warm dining-parlour, and enjoy her orange as she liked best. And so it was in everything. Miss Jenkyns\u2019s rules were made more stringent than ever, because the framer of them was gone where there could be no appeal. In all things else Miss Matilda was meek and undecided to a fault. I have heard Fanny turn her round twenty times in a morning about dinner, just as the little hussy chose; and I sometimes fancied she worked on Miss Matilda\u2019s weakness in order to bewilder her, and to make her feel more in the power of her clever servant. I determined that I would not leave her till I had seen what sort of a person Martha was; and, if I found her trustworthy, I would tell her not to trouble her mistress with every little decision.\n\nMartha was blunt and plain-spoken to a fault; otherwise she was a brisk, well-meaning, but very ignorant girl. She had not been with us a week before Miss Matilda and I were astounded one morning by the receipt of a letter from a cousin of hers, who had been twenty or thirty years in India, and who had lately, as we had seen by the \u201cArmy List,\u201d returned to England, bringing with him an invalid wife who had never been introduced to her English relations. Major Jenkyns wrote to propose that he and his wife should spend a night at Cranford, on his way to Scotland\u2014at the inn, if it did not suit Miss Matilda to receive them into her house; in which case they should hope to be with her as much as possible during the day. Of course it must suit her, as she said; for all Cranford knew that she had her sister\u2019s bedroom at liberty; but I am sure she wished the Major had stopped in India and forgotten his cousins out and out.\n\n\u201cOh! how must I manage?\u201d asked she helplessly. \u201cIf Deborah had been alive she would have known what to do with a gentleman-visitor. Must I put razors in his dressing-room? Dear! dear! and I\u2019ve got none. Deborah would have had them. And slippers, and coat-brushes?\u201d I suggested that probably he would bring all these things with him. \u201cAnd after dinner, how am I to know when to get up and leave him to his wine? Deborah would have done it so well; she would have been quite in her element. Will he want coffee, do you think?\u201d I undertook the management of the coffee, and told her I would instruct Martha in the art of waiting\u2014in which it must be owned she was terribly deficient\u2014and that I had no doubt Major and Mrs Jenkyns would understand the quiet mode in which a lady lived by herself in a country town. But she was sadly fluttered. I made her empty her decanters and bring up two fresh bottles of wine. I wished I could have prevented her from being present at my instructions to Martha, for she frequently cut in with some fresh direction, muddling the poor girl\u2019s mind as she stood open-mouthed, listening to us both.\n\n\u201cHand the vegetables round,\u201d said I (foolishly, I see now\u2014for it was aiming at more than we could accomplish with quietness and simplicity); and then, seeing her look bewildered, I added, \u201ctake the vegetables round to people, and let them help themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd mind you go first to the ladies,\u201d put in Miss Matilda. \u201cAlways go to the ladies before gentlemen when you are waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it as you tell me, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Martha; \u201cbut I like lads best.\u201d\n\nWe felt very uncomfortable and shocked at this speech of Martha\u2019s, yet I don\u2019t think she meant any harm; and, on the whole, she attended very well to our directions, except that she \u201cnudged\u201d the Major when he did not help himself as soon as she expected to the potatoes, while she was handing them round.\n\nThe major and his wife were quiet unpretending people enough when they did come; languid, as all East Indians are, I suppose. We were rather dismayed at their bringing two servants with them, a Hindoo body-servant for the Major, and a steady elderly maid for his wife; but they slept at the inn, and took off a good deal of the responsibility by attending carefully to their master\u2019s and mistress\u2019s comfort. Martha, to be sure, had never ended her staring at the East Indian\u2019s white turban and brown complexion, and I saw that Miss Matilda shrunk away from him a little as he waited at dinner. Indeed, she asked me, when they were gone, if he did not remind me of Blue Beard? On the whole, the visit was most satisfactory, and is a subject of conversation even now with Miss Matilda; at the time it greatly excited Cranford, and even stirred up the apathetic and Honourable Mrs Jamieson to some expression of interest, when I went to call and thank her for the kind answers she had vouchsafed to Miss Matilda\u2019s inquiries as to the arrangement of a gentleman\u2019s dressing-room\u2014answers which I must confess she had given in the wearied manner of the Scandinavian prophetess\u2014\n\n\u201cLeave me, leave me to repose.\u201d\n\nAnd now I come to the love affair.\n\nIt seems that Miss Pole had a cousin, once or twice removed, who had offered to Miss Matty long ago. Now this cousin lived four or five miles from Cranford on his own estate; but his property was not large enough to entitle him to rank higher than a yeoman; or rather, with something of the \u201cpride which apes humility,\u201d he had refused to push himself on, as so many of his class had done, into the ranks of the squires. He would not allow himself to be called Thomas Holbrook, Esq.; he even sent back letters with this address, telling the post-mistress at Cranford that his name was Mr Thomas Holbrook, yeoman. He rejected all domestic innovations; he would have the house door stand open in summer and shut in winter, without knocker or bell to summon a servant. The closed fist or the knob of a stick did this office for him if he found the door locked. He despised every refinement which had not its root deep down in humanity. If people were not ill, he saw no necessity for moderating his voice. He spoke the dialect of the country in perfection, and constantly used it in conversation; although Miss Pole (who gave me these particulars) added, that he read aloud more beautifully and with more feeling than any one she had ever heard, except the late rector.\n\n\u201cAnd how came Miss Matilda not to marry him?\u201d asked I.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. She was willing enough, I think; but you know Cousin Thomas would not have been enough of a gentleman for the rector and Miss Jenkyns.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell! but they were not to marry him,\u201d said I, impatiently.\n\n\u201cNo; but they did not like Miss Matty to marry below her rank. You know she was the rector\u2019s daughter, and somehow they are related to Sir Peter Arley: Miss Jenkyns thought a deal of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor Miss Matty!\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cNay, now, I don\u2019t know anything more than that he offered and was refused. Miss Matty might not like him\u2014and Miss Jenkyns might never have said a word\u2014it is only a guess of mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas she never seen him since?\u201d I inquired.\n\n\u201cNo, I think not. You see Woodley, Cousin Thomas\u2019s house, lies half-way between Cranford and Misselton; and I know he made Misselton his market-town very soon after he had offered to Miss Matty; and I don\u2019t think he has been into Cranford above once or twice since\u2014once, when I was walking with Miss Matty, in High Street, and suddenly she darted from me, and went up Shire Lane. A few minutes after I was startled by meeting Cousin Thomas.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow old is he?\u201d I asked, after a pause of castle-building.\n\n\u201cHe must be about seventy, I think, my dear,\u201d said Miss Pole, blowing up my castle, as if by gun-powder, into small fragments.\n\nVery soon after\u2014at least during my long visit to Miss Matilda\u2014I had the opportunity of seeing Mr Holbrook; seeing, too, his first encounter with his former love, after thirty or forty years\u2019 separation. I was helping to decide whether any of the new assortment of coloured silks which they had just received at the shop would do to match a grey and black mousseline-delaine that wanted a new breadth, when a tall, thin, Don Quixote-looking old man came into the shop for some woollen gloves. I had never seen the person (who was rather striking) before, and I watched him rather attentively while Miss Matty listened to the shopman. The stranger wore a blue coat with brass buttons, drab breeches, and gaiters, and drummed with his fingers on the counter until he was attended to. When he answered the shop-boy\u2019s question, \u201cWhat can I have the pleasure of showing you to-day, sir?\u201d I saw Miss Matilda start, and then suddenly sit down; and instantly I guessed who it was. She had made some inquiry which had to be carried round to the other shopman.\n\n\u201cMiss Jenkyns wants the black sarsenet two-and-twopence the yard\u201d; and Mr Holbrook had caught the name, and was across the shop in two strides.\n\n\u201cMatty\u2014Miss Matilda\u2014Miss Jenkyns! God bless my soul! I should not have known you. How are you? how are you?\u201d He kept shaking her hand in a way which proved the warmth of his friendship; but he repeated so often, as if to himself, \u201cI should not have known you!\u201d that any sentimental romance which I might be inclined to build was quite done away with by his manner.\n\nHowever, he kept talking to us all the time we were in the shop; and then waving the shopman with the unpurchased gloves on one side, with \u201cAnother time, sir! another time!\u201d he walked home with us. I am happy to say my client, Miss Matilda, also left the shop in an equally bewildered state, not having purchased either green or red silk. Mr Holbrook was evidently full with honest loud-spoken joy at meeting his old love again; he touched on the changes that had taken place; he even spoke of Miss Jenkyns as \u201cYour poor sister! Well, well! we have all our faults\u201d; and bade us good-bye with many a hope that he should soon see Miss Matty again. She went straight to her room, and never came back till our early tea-time, when I thought she looked as if she had been crying.\n\nMr Holbrook ... bade us good-bye\nCHAPTER IV.\nA VISIT TO AN OLD BACHELOR\n\nA few days after, a note came from Mr Holbrook, asking us\u2014impartially asking both of us\u2014in a formal, old-fashioned style, to spend a day at his house\u2014a long June day\u2014for it was June now. He named that he had also invited his cousin, Miss Pole; so that we might join in a fly, which could be put up at his house.\n\nI expected Miss Matty to jump at this invitation; but, no! Miss Pole and I had the greatest difficulty in persuading her to go. She thought it was improper; and was even half annoyed when we utterly ignored the idea of any impropriety in her going with two other ladies to see her old lover. Then came a more serious difficulty. She did not think Deborah would have liked her to go. This took us half a day\u2019s good hard talking to get over; but, at the first sentence of relenting, I seized the opportunity, and wrote and despatched an acceptance in her name\u2014fixing day and hour, that all might be decided and done with.\n\nThe next morning she asked me if I would go down to the shop with her; and there, after much hesitation, we chose out three caps to be sent home and tried on, that the most becoming might be selected to take with us on Thursday.\n\nShe was in a state of silent agitation all the way to Woodley. She had evidently never been there before; and, although she little dreamt I knew anything of her early story, I could perceive she was in a tremor at the thought of seeing the place which might have been her home, and round which it is probable that many of her innocent girlish imaginations had clustered. It was a long drive there, through paved jolting lanes. Miss Matilda sat bolt upright, and looked wistfully out of the windows as we drew near the end of our journey. The aspect of the country was quiet and pastoral. Woodley stood among fields; and there was an old-fashioned garden where roses and currant-bushes touched each other, and where the feathery asparagus formed a pretty background to the pinks and gilly-flowers; there was no drive up to the door. We got out at a little gate, and walked up a straight box-edged path.\n\n\u201cMy cousin might make a drive, I think,\u201d said Miss Pole, who was afraid of ear-ache, and had only her cap on.\n\n\u201cI think it is very pretty,\u201d said Miss Matty, with a soft plaintiveness in her voice, and almost in a whisper, for just then Mr Holbrook appeared at the door, rubbing his hands in very effervescence of hospitality. He looked more like my idea of Don Quixote than ever, and yet the likeness was only external. His respectable housekeeper stood modestly at the door to bid us welcome; and, while she led the elder ladies upstairs to a bedroom, I begged to look about the garden. My request evidently pleased the old gentleman, who took me all round the place and showed me his six-and-twenty cows, named after the different letters of the alphabet. As we went along, he surprised me occasionally by repeating apt and beautiful quotations from the poets, ranging easily from Shakespeare and George Herbert to those of our own day. He did this as naturally as if he were thinking aloud, and their true and beautiful words were the best expression he could find for what he was thinking or feeling. To be sure he called Byron \u201cmy Lord Byrron,\u201d and pronounced the name of Goethe strictly in accordance with the English sound of the letters\u2014\u201cAs Goethe says, \u2018Ye ever-verdant palaces,\u2019\u201d &c. Altogether, I never met with a man, before or since, who had spent so long a life in a secluded and not impressive country, with ever-increasing delight in the daily and yearly change of season and beauty.\n\nWhen he and I went in, we found that dinner was nearly ready in the kitchen\u2014for so I suppose the room ought to be called, as there were oak dressers and cupboards all round, all over by the side of the fireplace, and only a small Turkey carpet in the middle of the flag-floor. The room might have been easily made into a handsome dark oak dining-parlour by removing the oven and a few other appurtenances of a kitchen, which were evidently never used, the real cooking-place being at some distance. The room in which we were expected to sit was a stiffly-furnished, ugly apartment; but that in which we did sit was what Mr Holbrook called the counting-house, where he paid his labourers their weekly wages at a great desk near the door. The rest of the pretty sitting-room\u2014looking into the orchard, and all covered over with dancing tree-shadows\u2014was filled with books. They lay on the ground, they covered the walls, they strewed the table. He was evidently half ashamed and half proud of his extravagance in this respect. They were of all kinds\u2014poetry and wild weird tales prevailing. He evidently chose his books in accordance with his own tastes, not because such and such were classical or established favourites.\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d he said, \u201cwe farmers ought not to have much time for reading; yet somehow one can\u2019t help it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a pretty room!\u201d said Miss Matty, sotto voce.\n\n\u201cWhat a pleasant place!\u201d said I, aloud, almost simultaneously.\n\n\u201cNay! if you like it,\u201d replied he; \u201cbut can you sit on these great, black leather, three-cornered chairs? I like it better than the best parlour; but I thought ladies would take that for the smarter place.\u201d\n\nIt was the smarter place, but, like most smart things, not at all pretty, or pleasant, or home-like; so, while we were at dinner, the servant-girl dusted and scrubbed the counting-house chairs, and we sat there all the rest of the day.\n\nWe had pudding before meat; and I thought Mr Holbrook was going to make some apology for his old-fashioned ways, for he began\u2014\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether you like newfangled ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, not at all!\u201d said Miss Matty.\n\n\u201cNo more do I,\u201d said he. \u201cMy housekeeper will have these in her new fashion; or else I tell her that, when I was a young man, we used to keep strictly to my father\u2019s rule, \u2018No broth, no ball; no ball, no beef\u2019; and always began dinner with broth. Then we had suet puddings, boiled in the broth with the beef: and then the meat itself. If we did not sup our broth, we had no ball, which we liked a deal better; and the beef came last of all, and only those had it who had done justice to the broth and the ball. Now folks begin with sweet things, and turn their dinners topsy-turvy.\u201d\n\nWhen the ducks and green peas came, we looked at each other in dismay; we had only two-pronged, black-handled forks. It is true the steel was as bright as silver; but what were we to do? Miss Matty picked up her peas, one by one, on the point of the prongs, much as Amin\xe9 ate her grains of rice after her previous feast with the Ghoul. Miss Pole sighed over her delicate young peas as she left them on one side of her plate untasted, for they would drop between the prongs. I looked at my host: the peas were going wholesale into his capacious mouth, shovelled up by his large round-ended knife. I saw, I imitated, I survived! My friends, in spite of my precedent, could not muster up courage enough to do an ungenteel thing; and, if Mr Holbrook had not been so heartily hungry, he would probably have seen that the good peas went away almost untouched.\n\nAfter dinner, a clay pipe was brought in, and a spittoon; and, asking us to retire to another room, where he would soon join us, if we disliked tobacco-smoke, he presented his pipe to Miss Matty, and requested her to fill the bowl. This was a compliment to a lady in his youth; but it was rather inappropriate to propose it as an honour to Miss Matty, who had been trained by her sister to hold smoking of every kind in utter abhorrence. But if it was a shock to her refinement, it was also a gratification to her feelings to be thus selected; so she daintily stuffed the strong tobacco into the pipe, and then we withdrew.\n\n\u201cIt is very pleasant dining with a bachelor,\u201d said Miss Matty softly, as we settled ourselves in the counting-house. \u201cI only hope it is not improper; so many pleasant things are!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a number of books he has!\u201d said Miss Pole, looking round the room. \u201cAnd how dusty they are!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it must be like one of the great Dr Johnson\u2019s rooms,\u201d said Miss Matty. \u201cWhat a superior man your cousin must be!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d said Miss Pole, \u201che\u2019s a great reader; but I am afraid he has got into very uncouth habits with living alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! uncouth is too hard a word. I should call him eccentric; very clever people always are!\u201d replied Miss Matty.\n\nNow, what colour are ash-buds in March\n\nWhen Mr Holbrook returned, he proposed a walk in the fields; but the two elder ladies were afraid of damp, and dirt, and had only very unbecoming calashes to put on over their caps; so they declined, and I was again his companion in a turn which he said he was obliged to take to see after his men. He strode along, either wholly forgetting my existence, or soothed into silence by his pipe\u2014and yet it was not silence exactly. He walked before me with a stooping gait, his hands clasped behind him; and, as some tree or cloud, or glimpse of distant upland pastures, struck him, he quoted poetry to himself, saying it out loud in a grand sonorous voice, with just the emphasis that true feeling and appreciation give. We came upon an old cedar tree, which stood at one end of the house\u2014\n\n\u201cThe cedar spreads his dark-green layers of shade.\u201d\n\n\u201cCapital term\u2014\u2018layers!\u2019 Wonderful man!\u201d I did not know whether he was speaking to me or not; but I put in an assenting \u201cwonderful,\u201d although I knew nothing about it, just because I was tired of being forgotten, and of being consequently silent.\n\nHe turned sharp round. \u201cAy! you may say \u2018wonderful.\u2019 Why, when I saw the review of his poems in Blackwood, I set off within an hour, and walked seven miles to Misselton (for the horses were not in the way) and ordered them. Now, what colour are ash-buds in March?\u201d\n\nIs the man going mad? thought I. He is very like Don Quixote.\n\n\u201cWhat colour are they, I say?\u201d repeated he vehemently.\n\n\u201cI am sure I don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d said I, with the meekness of ignorance.\n\n\u201cI knew you didn\u2019t. No more did I\u2014an old fool that I am!\u2014till this young man comes and tells me. Black as ash-buds in March. And I\u2019ve lived all my life in the country; more shame for me not to know. Black: they are jet-black, madam.\u201d And he went off again, swinging along to the music of some rhyme he had got hold of.\n\nWhen we came back, nothing would serve him but he must read us the poems he had been speaking of; and Miss Pole encouraged him in his proposal, I thought, because she wished me to hear his beautiful reading, of which she had boasted; but she afterwards said it was because she had got to a difficult part of her crochet, and wanted to count her stitches without having to talk. Whatever he had proposed would have been right to Miss Matty; although she did fall sound asleep within five minutes after he had begun a long poem, called \u201cLocksley Hall,\u201d and had a comfortable nap, unobserved, till he ended; when the cessation of his voice wakened her up, and she said, feeling that something was expected, and that Miss Pole was counting\u2014\n\n\u201cWhat a pretty book!\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty, madam! it\u2019s beautiful! Pretty, indeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes! I meant beautiful!\u201d said she, fluttered at his disapproval of her word. \u201cIt is so like that beautiful poem of Dr Johnson\u2019s my sister used to read\u2014I forget the name of it; what was it, my dear?\u201d turning to me.\n\n\u201cWhich do you mean, ma\u2019am? What was it about?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember what it was about, and I\u2019ve quite forgotten what the name of it was; but it was written by Dr Johnson, and was very beautiful, and very like what Mr Holbrook has just been reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember it,\u201d said he reflectively. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know Dr Johnson\u2019s poems well. I must read them.\u201d\n\nAs we were getting into the fly to return, I heard Mr Holbrook say he should call on the ladies soon, and inquire how they got home; and this evidently pleased and fluttered Miss Matty at the time he said it; but after we had lost sight of the old house among the trees her sentiments towards the master of it were gradually absorbed into a distressing wonder as to whether Martha had broken her word, and seized on the opportunity of her mistress\u2019s absence to have a \u201cfollower.\u201d Martha looked good, and steady, and composed enough, as she came to help us out; she was always careful of Miss Matty, and to-night she made use of this unlucky speech\u2014\n\n\u201cEh! dear ma\u2019am, to think of your going out in an evening in such a thin shawl! It\u2019s no better than muslin. At your age, ma\u2019am, you should be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy age!\u201d said Miss Matty, almost speaking crossly, for her, for she was usually gentle\u2014\u201cMy age! Why, how old do you think I am, that you talk about my age?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, ma\u2019am, I should say you were not far short of sixty: but folks\u2019 looks is often against them\u2014and I\u2019m sure I meant no harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cMartha, I\u2019m not yet fifty-two!\u201d said Miss Matty, with grave emphasis; for probably the remembrance of her youth had come very vividly before her this day, and she was annoyed at finding that golden time so far away in the past.\n\nBut she never spoke of any former and more intimate acquaintance with Mr Holbrook. She had probably met with so little sympathy in her early love, that she had shut it up close in her heart; and it was only by a sort of watching, which I could hardly avoid since Miss Pole\u2019s confidence, that I saw how faithful her poor heart had been in its sorrow and its silence.\n\nShe gave me some good reason for wearing her best cap every day, and sat near the window, in spite of her rheumatism, in order to see, without being seen, down into the street.\n\nHe came. He put his open palms upon his knees, which were far apart, as he sat with his head bent down, whistling, after we had replied to his inquiries about our safe return. Suddenly he jumped up\u2014\n\n\u201cWell, madam! have you any commands for Paris? I am going there in a week or two.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo Paris!\u201d we both exclaimed.\n\n\u201cYes, madam! I\u2019ve never been there, and always had a wish to go; and I think if I don\u2019t go soon, I mayn\u2019t go at all; so as soon as the hay is got in I shall go, before harvest time.\u201d\n\nWe were so much astonished that we had no commissions.\n\nJust as he was going out of the room, he turned back, with his favourite exclamation\u2014\n\n\u201cGod bless my soul, madam! but I nearly forgot half my errand. Here are the poems for you you admired so much the other evening at my house.\u201d He tugged away at a parcel in his coat-pocket. \u201cGood-bye, miss,\u201d said he; \u201cgood-bye, Matty! take care of yourself.\u201d And he was gone. But he had given her a book, and he had called her Matty, just as he used to do thirty years ago.\n\n\u201cI wish he would not go to Paris,\u201d said Miss Matilda anxiously. \u201cI don\u2019t believe frogs will agree with him; he used to have to be very careful what he ate, which was curious in so strong-looking a young man.\u201d\n\nSoon after this I took my leave, giving many an injunction to Martha to look after her mistress, and to let me know if she thought that Miss Matilda was not so well; in which case I would volunteer a visit to my old friend, without noticing Martha\u2019s intelligence to her.\n\nAccordingly I received a line or two from Martha every now and then; and, about November I had a note to say her mistress was \u201cvery low and sadly off her food\u201d; and the account made me so uneasy that, although Martha did not decidedly summon me, I packed up my things and went.\n\nI received a warm welcome, in spite of the little flurry produced by my impromptu visit, for I had only been able to give a day\u2019s notice. Miss Matilda looked miserably ill; and I prepared to comfort and cosset her.\n\nI went down to have a private talk with Martha.\n\n\u201cHow long has your mistress been so poorly?\u201d I asked, as I stood by the kitchen fire.\n\n\u201cWell! I think it\u2019s better than a fortnight; it is, I know; it was one Tuesday, after Miss Pole had been, that she went into this moping way. I thought she was tired, and it would go off with a night\u2019s rest; but no! she has gone on and on ever since, till I thought it my duty to write to you, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did quite right, Martha. It is a comfort to think she has so faithful a servant about her. And I hope you find your place comfortable?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, ma\u2019am, missus is very kind, and there\u2019s plenty to eat and drink, and no more work but what I can do easily\u2014but\u2014\u201d Martha hesitated.\n\n\u201cBut what, Martha?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, it seems so hard of missus not to let me have any followers; there\u2019s such lots of young fellows in the town; and many a one has as much as offered to keep company with me; and I may never be in such a likely place again, and it\u2019s like wasting an opportunity. Many a girl as I know would have \u2019em unbeknownst to missus; but I\u2019ve given my word, and I\u2019ll stick to it; or else this is just the house for missus never to be the wiser if they did come: and it\u2019s such a capable kitchen\u2014there\u2019s such dark corners in it\u2014I\u2019d be bound to hide any one. I counted up last Sunday night\u2014for I\u2019ll not deny I was crying because I had to shut the door in Jem Hearn\u2019s face, and he\u2019s a steady young man, fit for any girl; only I had given missus my word.\u201d Martha was all but crying again; and I had little comfort to give her, for I knew, from old experience, of the horror with which both the Miss Jenkynses looked upon \u201cfollowers\u201d; and in Miss Matty\u2019s present nervous state this dread was not likely to be lessened.\n\nI went to see Miss Pole the next day, and took her completely by surprise, for she had not been to see Miss Matilda for two days.\n\n\u201cAnd now I must go back with you, my dear, for I promised to let her know how Thomas Holbrook went on; and, I\u2019m sorry to say, his housekeeper has sent me word to-day that he hasn\u2019t long to live. Poor Thomas! that journey to Paris was quite too much for him. His housekeeper says he has hardly ever been round his fields since, but just sits with his hands on his knees in the counting-house, not reading or anything, but only saying what a wonderful city Paris was! Paris has much to answer for if it\u2019s killed my cousin Thomas, for a better man never lived.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes Miss Matilda know of his illness?\u201d asked I\u2014a new light as to the cause of her indisposition dawning upon me.\n\n\u201cDear! to be sure, yes! Has not she told you? I let her know a fortnight ago, or more, when first I heard of it. How odd she shouldn\u2019t have told you!\u201d\n\nNot at all, I thought; but I did not say anything. I felt almost guilty of having spied too curiously into that tender heart, and I was not going to speak of its secrets\u2014hidden, Miss Matty believed, from all the world. I ushered Miss Pole into Miss Matilda\u2019s little drawing-room, and then left them alone. But I was not surprised when Martha came to my bedroom door, to ask me to go down to dinner alone, for that missus had one of her bad headaches. She came into the drawing-room at tea-time, but it was evidently an effort to her; and, as if to make up for some reproachful feeling against her late sister, Miss Jenkyns, which had been troubling her all the afternoon, and for which she now felt penitent, she kept telling me how good and how clever Deborah was in her youth; how she used to settle what gowns they were to wear at all the parties (faint, ghostly ideas of grim parties, far away in the distance, when Miss Matty and Miss Pole were young!); and how Deborah and her mother had started the benefit society for the poor, and taught girls cooking and plain sewing; and how Deborah had once danced with a lord; and how she used to visit at Sir Peter Arley\u2019s, and tried to remodel the quiet rectory establishment on the plans of Arley Hall, where they kept thirty servants; and how she had nursed Miss Matty through a long, long illness, of which I had never heard before, but which I now dated in my own mind as following the dismissal of the suit of Mr Holbrook. So we talked softly and quietly of old times through the long November evening.\n\nThe next day Miss Pole brought us word that Mr Holbrook was dead. Miss Matty heard the news in silence; in fact, from the account of the previous day, it was only what we had to expect. Miss Pole kept calling upon us for some expression of regret, by asking if it was not sad that he was gone, and saying\u2014\n\n\u201cTo think of that pleasant day last June, when he seemed so well! And he might have lived this dozen years if he had not gone to that wicked Paris, where they are always having revolutions.\u201d\n\nShe paused for some demonstration on our part. I saw Miss Matty could not speak, she was trembling so nervously; so I said what I really felt; and after a call of some duration\u2014all the time of which I have no doubt Miss Pole thought Miss Matty received the news very calmly\u2014our visitor took her leave.\n\nMiss Matty made a strong effort to conceal her feelings\u2014a concealment she practised even with me, for she has never alluded to Mr Holbrook again, although the book he gave her lies with her Bible on the little table by her bedside. She did not think I heard her when she asked the little milliner of Cranford to make her caps something like the Honourable Mrs Jamieson\u2019s, or that I noticed the reply\u2014\n\n\u201cBut she wears widows\u2019 caps, ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! I only meant something in that style; not widows\u2019, of course, but rather like Mrs Jamieson\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThis effort at concealment was the beginning of the tremulous motion of head and hands which I have seen ever since in Miss Matty.\n\nThe evening of the day on which we heard of Mr Holbrook\u2019s death, Miss Matilda was very silent and thoughtful; after prayers she called Martha back and then she stood uncertain what to say.\n\n\u201cMartha!\u201d she said, at last, \u201cyou are young\u201d\u2014and then she made so long a pause that Martha, to remind her of her half-finished sentence, dropped a curtsey, and said\u2014\n\n\u201cYes, please, ma\u2019am; two-and-twenty last third of October, please, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd, perhaps, Martha, you may some time meet with a young man you like, and who likes you. I did say you were not to have followers; but if you meet with such a young man, and tell me, and I find he is respectable, I have no objection to his coming to see you once a week. God forbid!\u201d said she in a low voice, \u201cthat I should grieve any young hearts.\u201d She spoke as if she were providing for some distant contingency, and was rather startled when Martha made her ready eager answer\u2014\n\n\u201cPlease, ma\u2019am, there\u2019s Jem Hearn, and he\u2019s a joiner making three-and-sixpence a-day, and six foot one in his stocking-feet, please, ma\u2019am; and if you\u2019ll ask about him to-morrow morning, every one will give him a character for steadiness; and he\u2019ll be glad enough to come to-morrow night, I\u2019ll be bound.\u201d\n\nThough Miss Matty was startled, she submitted to Fate and Love.\nCHAPTER V.\nOLD LETTERS\n\nI have often noticed that almost every one has his own individual small economies\u2014careful habits of saving fractions of pennies in some one peculiar direction\u2014any disturbance of which annoys him more than spending shillings or pounds on some real extravagance. An old gentleman of my acquaintance, who took the intelligence of the failure of a Joint-Stock Bank, in which some of his money was invested, with stoical mildness, worried his family all through a long summer\u2019s day because one of them had torn (instead of cutting) out the written leaves of his now useless bank-book; of course, the corresponding pages at the other end came out as well, and this little unnecessary waste of paper (his private economy) chafed him more than all the loss of his money. Envelopes fretted his soul terribly when they first came in; the only way in which he could reconcile himself to such waste of his cherished article was by patiently turning inside out all that were sent to him, and so making them serve again. Even now, though tamed by age, I see him casting wistful glances at his daughters when they send a whole inside of a half-sheet of note paper, with the three lines of acceptance to an invitation, written on only one of the sides. I am not above owning that I have this human weakness myself. String is my foible. My pockets get full of little hanks of it, picked up and twisted together, ready for uses that never come. I am seriously annoyed if any one cuts the string of a parcel instead of patiently and faithfully undoing it fold by fold. How people can bring themselves to use india-rubber rings, which are a sort of deification of string, as lightly as they do, I cannot imagine. To me an india-rubber ring is a precious treasure. I have one which is not new\u2014one that I picked up off the floor nearly six years ago. I have really tried to use it, but my heart failed me, and I could not commit the extravagance.\n\nSmall pieces of butter grieve others. They cannot attend to conversation because of the annoyance occasioned by the habit which some people have of invariably taking more butter than they want. Have you not seen the anxious look (almost mesmeric) which such persons fix on the article? They would feel it a relief if they might bury it out of their sight by popping it into their own mouths and swallowing it down; and they are really made happy if the person on whose plate it lies unused suddenly breaks off a piece of toast (which he does not want at all) and eats up his butter. They think that this is not waste.\n\nNow Miss Matty Jenkyns was chary of candles. We had many devices to use as few as possible. In the winter afternoons she would sit knitting for two or three hours\u2014she could do this in the dark, or by firelight\u2014and when I asked if I might not ring for candles to finish stitching my wristbands, she told me to \u201ckeep blind man\u2019s holiday.\u201d They were usually brought in with tea; but we only burnt one at a time. As we lived in constant preparation for a friend who might come in any evening (but who never did), it required some contrivance to keep our two candles of the same length, ready to be lighted, and to look as if we burnt two always. The candles took it in turns; and, whatever we might be talking about or doing, Miss Matty\u2019s eyes were habitually fixed upon the candle, ready to jump up and extinguish it and to light the other before they had become too uneven in length to be restored to equality in the course of the evening.\n\nOne night, I remember this candle economy particularly annoyed me. I had been very much tired of my compulsory \u201cblind man\u2019s holiday,\u201d especially as Miss Matty had fallen asleep, and I did not like to stir the fire and run the risk of awakening her; so I could not even sit on the rug, and scorch myself with sewing by firelight, according to my usual custom. I fancied Miss Matty must be dreaming of her early life; for she spoke one or two words in her uneasy sleep bearing reference to persons who were dead long before. When Martha brought in the lighted candle and tea, Miss Matty started into wakefulness, with a strange, bewildered look around, as if we were not the people she expected to see about her. There was a little sad expression that shadowed her face as she recognised me; but immediately afterwards she tried to give me her usual smile. All through tea-time her talk ran upon the days of her childhood and youth. Perhaps this reminded her of the desirableness of looking over all the old family letters, and destroying such as ought not to be allowed to fall into the hands of strangers; for she had often spoken of the necessity of this task, but had always shrunk from it, with a timid dread of something painful. To-night, however, she rose up after tea and went for them\u2014in the dark; for she piqued herself on the precise neatness of all her chamber arrangements, and used to look uneasily at me when I lighted a bed-candle to go to another room for anything. When she returned there was a faint, pleasant smell of Tonquin beans in the room. I had always noticed this scent about any of the things which had belonged to her mother; and many of the letters were addressed to her\u2014yellow bundles of love-letters, sixty or seventy years old.\n\nMiss Matty undid the packet with a sigh; but she stifled it directly, as if it were hardly right to regret the flight of time, or of life either. We agreed to look them over separately, each taking a different letter out of the same bundle and describing its contents to the other before destroying it. I never knew what sad work the reading of old letters was before that evening, though I could hardly tell why. The letters were as happy as letters could be\u2014at least those early letters were. There was in them a vivid and intense sense of the present time, which seemed so strong and full, as if it could never pass away, and as if the warm, living hearts that so expressed themselves could never die, and be as nothing to the sunny earth. I should have felt less melancholy, I believe, if the letters had been more so. I saw the tears stealing down the well-worn furrows of Miss Matty\u2019s cheeks, and her spectacles often wanted wiping. I trusted at last that she would light the other candle, for my own eyes were rather dim, and I wanted more light to see the pale, faded ink; but no, even through her tears, she saw and remembered her little economical ways.\n\nThe earliest set of letters were two bundles tied together, and ticketed (in Miss Jenkyns\u2019s handwriting) \u201cLetters interchanged between my ever-honoured father and my dearly-beloved mother, prior to their marriage, in July 1774.\u201d I should guess that the rector of Cranford was about twenty-seven years of age when he wrote those letters; and Miss Matty told me that her mother was just eighteen at the time of her wedding. With my idea of the rector derived from a picture in the dining-parlour, stiff and stately, in a huge full-bottomed wig, with gown, cassock, and bands, and his hand upon a copy of the only sermon he ever published\u2014it was strange to read these letters. They were full of eager, passionate ardour; short homely sentences, right fresh from the heart (very different from the grand Latinised, Johnsonian style of the printed sermon preached before some judge at assize time). His letters were a curious contrast to those of his girl-bride. She was evidently rather annoyed at his demands upon her for expressions of love, and could not quite understand what he meant by repeating the same thing over in so many different ways; but what she was quite clear about was a longing for a white \u201cPaduasoy\u201d\u2014whatever that might be; and six or seven letters were principally occupied in asking her lover to use his influence with her parents (who evidently kept her in good order) to obtain this or that article of dress, more especially the white \u201cPaduasoy.\u201d He cared nothing how she was dressed; she was always lovely enough for him, as he took pains to assure her, when she begged him to express in his answers a predilection for particular pieces of finery, in order that she might show what he said to her parents. But at length he seemed to find out that she would not be married till she had a \u201ctrousseau\u201d to her mind; and then he sent her a letter, which had evidently accompanied a whole box full of finery, and in which he requested that she might be dressed in everything her heart desired. This was the first letter, ticketed in a frail, delicate hand, \u201cFrom my dearest John.\u201d Shortly afterwards they were married, I suppose, from the intermission in their correspondence.\n\n\u201cWe must burn them, I think,\u201d said Miss Matty, looking doubtfully at me. \u201cNo one will care for them when I am gone.\u201d And one by one she dropped them into the middle of the fire, watching each blaze up, die out, and rise away, in faint, white, ghostly semblance, up the chimney, before she gave another to the same fate. The room was light enough now; but I, like her, was fascinated into watching the destruction of those letters, into which the honest warmth of a manly heart had been poured forth.\n\nThe next letter, likewise docketed by Miss Jenkyns, was endorsed, \u201cLetter of pious congratulation and exhortation from my venerable grandfather to my beloved mother, on occasion of my own birth. Also some practical remarks on the desirability of keeping warm the extremities of infants, from my excellent grandmother.\u201d\n\nThe first part was, indeed, a severe and forcible picture of the responsibilities of mothers, and a warning against the evils that were in the world, and lying in ghastly wait for the little baby of two days old. His wife did not write, said the old gentleman, because he had forbidden it, she being indisposed with a sprained ankle, which (he said) quite incapacitated her from holding a pen. However, at the foot of the page was a small \u201cT.O.,\u201d and on turning it over, sure enough, there was a letter to \u201cmy dear, dearest Molly,\u201d begging her, when she left her room, whatever she did, to go up stairs before going down: and telling her to wrap her baby\u2019s feet up in flannel, and keep it warm by the fire, although it was summer, for babies were so tender.\n\nIt was pretty to see from the letters, which were evidently exchanged with some frequency between the young mother and the grandmother, how the girlish vanity was being weeded out of her heart by love for her baby. The white \u201cPaduasoy\u201d figured again in the letters, with almost as much vigour as before. In one, it was being made into a christening cloak for the baby. It decked it when it went with its parents to spend a day or two at Arley Hall. It added to its charms, when it was \u201cthe prettiest little baby that ever was seen. Dear mother, I wish you could see her! Without any pershality, I do think she will grow up a regular bewty!\u201d I thought of Miss Jenkyns, grey, withered, and wrinkled, and I wondered if her mother had known her in the courts of heaven: and then I knew that she had, and that they stood there in angelic guise.\n\nThere was a great gap before any of the rector\u2019s letters appeared. And then his wife had changed her mode of her endorsement. It was no longer from, \u201cMy dearest John;\u201d it was from \u201cMy Honoured Husband.\u201d The letters were written on occasion of the publication of the same sermon which was represented in the picture. The preaching before \u201cMy Lord Judge,\u201d and the \u201cpublishing by request,\u201d was evidently the culminating point\u2014the event of his life. It had been necessary for him to go up to London to superintend it through the press. Many friends had to be called upon and consulted before he could decide on any printer fit for so onerous a task; and at length it was arranged that J. and J. Rivingtons were to have the honourable responsibility. The worthy rector seemed to be strung up by the occasion to a high literary pitch, for he could hardly write a letter to his wife without cropping out into Latin. I remember the end of one of his letters ran thus: \u201cI shall ever hold the virtuous qualities of my Molly in remembrance, dum memor ipse mei, dum spiritus regit artus,\u201d which, considering that the English of his correspondent was sometimes at fault in grammar, and often in spelling, might be taken as a proof of how much he \u201cidealised his Molly;\u201d and, as Miss Jenkyns used to say, \u201cPeople talk a great deal about idealising now-a-days, whatever that may mean.\u201d But this was nothing to a fit of writing classical poetry which soon seized him, in which his Molly figured away as \u201cMaria.\u201d The letter containing the carmen was endorsed by her, \u201cHebrew verses sent me by my honoured husband. I thowt to have had a letter about killing the pig, but must wait. Mem., to send the poetry to Sir Peter Arley, as my husband desires.\u201d And in a post-scriptum note in his handwriting it was stated that the Ode had appeared in the Gentleman\u2019s Magazine, December 1782.\n\nHer letters back to her husband (treasured as fondly by him as if they had been M. T. Ciceronis Epistol\xe6) were more satisfactory to an absent husband and father than his could ever have been to her. She told him how Deborah sewed her seam very neatly every day, and read to her in the books he had set her; how she was a very \u201cforrard,\u201d good child, but would ask questions her mother could not answer, but how she did not let herself down by saying she did not know, but took to stirring the fire, or sending the \u201cforrard\u201d child on an errand. Matty was now the mother\u2019s darling, and promised (like her sister at her age), to be a great beauty. I was reading this aloud to Miss Matty, who smiled and sighed a little at the hope, so fondly expressed, that \u201clittle Matty might not be vain, even if she were a bewty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had very pretty hair, my dear,\u201d said Miss Matilda; \u201cand not a bad mouth.\u201d And I saw her soon afterwards adjust her cap and draw herself up.\n\nBut to return to Mrs Jenkyns\u2019s letters. She told her husband about the poor in the parish; what homely domestic medicines she had administered; what kitchen physic she had sent. She had evidently held his displeasure as a rod in pickle over the heads of all the ne\u2019er-do-wells. She asked for his directions about the cows and pigs; and did not always obtain them, as I have shown before.\n\nThe kind old grandmother was dead when a little boy was born, soon after the publication of the sermon; but there was another letter of exhortation from the grandfather, more stringent and admonitory than ever, now that there was a boy to be guarded from the snares of the world. He described all the various sins into which men might fall, until I wondered how any man ever came to a natural death. The gallows seemed as if it must have been the termination of the lives of most of the grandfather\u2019s friends and acquaintance; and I was not surprised at the way in which he spoke of this life being \u201ca vale of tears.\u201d\n\nIt seemed curious that I should never have heard of this brother before; but I concluded that he had died young, or else surely his name would have been alluded to by his sisters.\n\nBy-and-by we came to packets of Miss Jenkyns\u2019s letters. These Miss Matty did regret to burn. She said all the others had been only interesting to those who loved the writers, and that it seemed as if it would have hurt her to allow them to fall into the hands of strangers, who had not known her dear mother, and how good she was, although she did not always spell, quite in the modern fashion; but Deborah\u2019s letters were so very superior! Any one might profit by reading them. It was a long time since she had read Mrs Chapone, but she knew she used to think that Deborah could have said the same things quite as well; and as for Mrs Carter! people thought a deal of her letters, just because she had written \u201cEpictetus,\u201d but she was quite sure Deborah would never have made use of such a common expression as \u201cI canna be fashed!\u201d\n\nI made use of the time to think of many other things\n\nMiss Matty did grudge burning these letters, it was evident. She would not let them be carelessly passed over with any quiet reading, and skipping, to myself. She took them from me, and even lighted the second candle in order to read them aloud with a proper emphasis, and without stumbling over the big words. Oh dear! how I wanted facts instead of reflections, before those letters were concluded! They lasted us two nights; and I won\u2019t deny that I made use of the time to think of many other things, and yet I was always at my post at the end of each sentence.\n\nThe rector\u2019s letters, and those of his wife and mother-in-law, had all been tolerably short and pithy, written in a straight hand, with the lines very close together. Sometimes the whole letter was contained on a mere scrap of paper. The paper was very yellow, and the ink very brown; some of the sheets were (as Miss Matty made me observe) the old original post, with the stamp in the corner representing a post-boy riding for life and twanging his horn. The letters of Mrs Jenkyns and her mother were fastened with a great round red wafer; for it was before Miss Edgeworth\u2019s \u201cpatronage\u201d had banished wafers from polite society. It was evident, from the tenor of what was said, that franks were in great request, and were even used as a means of paying debts by needy members of Parliament. The rector sealed his epistles with an immense coat of arms, and showed by the care with which he had performed this ceremony that he expected they should be cut open, not broken by any thoughtless or impatient hand. Now, Miss Jenkyns\u2019s letters were of a later date in form and writing. She wrote on the square sheet which we have learned to call old-fashioned. Her hand was admirably calculated, together with her use of many-syllabled words, to fill up a sheet, and then came the pride and delight of crossing. Poor Miss Matty got sadly puzzled with this, for the words gathered size like snowballs, and towards the end of her letter Miss Jenkyns used to become quite sesquipedalian. In one to her father, slightly theological and controversial in its tone, she had spoken of Herod, Tetrarch of Idumea. Miss Matty read it \u201cHerod Petrarch of Etruria,\u201d and was just as well pleased as if she had been right.\n\nI can\u2019t quite remember the date, but I think it was in 1805 that Miss Jenkyns wrote the longest series of letters\u2014on occasion of her absence on a visit to some friends near Newcastle-upon-Tyne. These friends were intimate with the commandant of the garrison there, and heard from him of all the preparations that were being made to repel the invasion of Buonaparte, which some people imagined might take place at the mouth of the Tyne. Miss Jenkyns was evidently very much alarmed; and the first part of her letters was often written in pretty intelligible English, conveying particulars of the preparations which were made in the family with whom she was residing against the dreaded event; the bundles of clothes that were packed up ready for a flight to Alston Moor (a wild hilly piece of ground between Northumberland and Cumberland); the signal that was to be given for this flight, and for the simultaneous turning out of the volunteers under arms\u2014which said signal was to consist (if I remember rightly) in ringing the church bells in a particular and ominous manner. One day, when Miss Jenkyns and her hosts were at a dinner-party in Newcastle, this warning summons was actually given (not a very wise proceeding, if there be any truth in the moral attached to the fable of the Boy and the Wolf; but so it was), and Miss Jenkyns, hardly recovered from her fright, wrote the next day to describe the sound, the breathless shock, the hurry and alarm; and then, taking breath, she added, \u201cHow trivial, my dear father, do all our apprehensions of the last evening appear, at the present moment, to calm and enquiring minds!\u201d And here Miss Matty broke in with\u2014\n\n\u201cBut, indeed, my dear, they were not at all trivial or trifling at the time. I know I used to wake up in the night many a time and think I heard the tramp of the French entering Cranford. Many people talked of hiding themselves in the salt mines\u2014and meat would have kept capitally down there, only perhaps we should have been thirsty. And my father preached a whole set of sermons on the occasion; one set in the mornings, all about David and Goliath, to spirit up the people to fighting with spades or bricks, if need were; and the other set in the afternoons, proving that Napoleon (that was another name for Bony, as we used to call him) was all the same as an Apollyon and Abaddon. I remember my father rather thought he should be asked to print this last set; but the parish had, perhaps, had enough of them with hearing.\u201d\n\nPeter Marmaduke Arley Jenkyns (\u201cpoor Peter!\u201d as Miss Matty began to call him) was at school at Shrewsbury by this time. The rector took up his pen, and rubbed up his Latin once more, to correspond with his boy. It was very clear that the lad\u2019s were what are called show letters. They were of a highly mental description, giving an account of his studies, and his intellectual hopes of various kinds, with an occasional quotation from the classics; but, now and then, the animal nature broke out in such a little sentence as this, evidently written in a trembling hurry, after the letter had been inspected: \u201cMother dear, do send me a cake, and put plenty of citron in.\u201d The \u201cmother dear\u201d probably answered her boy in the form of cakes and \u201cgoody,\u201d for there were none of her letters among this set; but a whole collection of the rector\u2019s, to whom the Latin in his boy\u2019s letters was like a trumpet to the old war-horse. I do not know much about Latin, certainly, and it is, perhaps, an ornamental language, but not very useful, I think\u2014at least to judge from the bits I remember out of the rector\u2019s letters. One was, \u201cYou have not got that town in your map of Ireland; but Bonus Bernardus non videt omnia, as the Proverbia say.\u201d Presently it became very evident that \u201cpoor Peter\u201d got himself into many scrapes. There were letters of stilted penitence to his father, for some wrong-doing; and among them all was a badly-written, badly-sealed, badly-directed, blotted note:\u2014\u201cMy dear, dear, dear, dearest mother, I will be a better boy; I will, indeed; but don\u2019t, please, be ill for me; I am not worth it; but I will be good, darling mother.\u201d\n\nMiss Matty could not speak for crying, after she had read this note. She gave it to me in silence, and then got up and took it to her sacred recesses in her own room, for fear, by any chance, it might get burnt. \u201cPoor Peter!\u201d she said; \u201che was always in scrapes; he was too easy. They led him wrong, and then left him in the lurch. But he was too fond of mischief. He could never resist a joke. Poor Peter!\u201d\nCHAPTER VI.\nPOOR PETER\n\nPoor Peter\u2019s career lay before him rather pleasantly mapped out by kind friends, but Bonus Bernardus non videt omnia, in this map too. He was to win honours at the Shrewsbury School, and carry them thick to Cambridge, and after that, a living awaited him, the gift of his godfather, Sir Peter Arley. Poor Peter! his lot in life was very different to what his friends had hoped and planned. Miss Matty told me all about it, and I think it was a relief when she had done so.\n\nHe was the darling of his mother, who seemed to dote on all her children, though she was, perhaps, a little afraid of Deborah\u2019s superior acquirements. Deborah was the favourite of her father, and when Peter disappointed him, she became his pride. The sole honour Peter brought away from Shrewsbury was the reputation of being the best good fellow that ever was, and of being the captain of the school in the art of practical joking. His father was disappointed, but set about remedying the matter in a manly way. He could not afford to send Peter to read with any tutor, but he could read with him himself; and Miss Matty told me much of the awful preparations in the way of dictionaries and lexicons that were made in her father\u2019s study the morning Peter began.\n\n\u201cMy poor mother!\u201d said she. \u201cI remember how she used to stand in the hall, just near enough the study-door, to catch the tone of my father\u2019s voice. I could tell in a moment if all was going right, by her face. And it did go right for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat went wrong at last?\u201d said I. \u201cThat tiresome Latin, I dare say.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! it was not the Latin. Peter was in high favour with my father, for he worked up well for him. But he seemed to think that the Cranford people might be joked about, and made fun of, and they did not like it; nobody does. He was always hoaxing them; \u2018hoaxing\u2019 is not a pretty word, my dear, and I hope you won\u2019t tell your father I used it, for I should not like him to think that I was not choice in my language, after living with such a woman as Deborah. And be sure you never use it yourself. I don\u2019t know how it slipped out of my mouth, except it was that I was thinking of poor Peter and it was always his expression. But he was a very gentlemanly boy in many things. He was like dear Captain Brown in always being ready to help any old person or a child. Still, he did like joking and making fun; and he seemed to think the old ladies in Cranford would believe anything. There were many old ladies living here then; we are principally ladies now, I know, but we are not so old as the ladies used to be when I was a girl. I could laugh to think of some of Peter\u2019s jokes. No, my dear, I won\u2019t tell you of them, because they might not shock you as they ought to do, and they were very shocking. He even took in my father once, by dressing himself up as a lady that was passing through the town and wished to see the Rector of Cranford, \u2018who had published that admirable Assize Sermon.\u2019 Peter said he was awfully frightened himself when he saw how my father took it all in, and even offered to copy out all his Napoleon Buonaparte sermons for her\u2014him, I mean\u2014no, her, for Peter was a lady then. He told me he was more terrified than he ever was before, all the time my father was speaking. He did not think my father would have believed him; and yet if he had not, it would have been a sad thing for Peter. As it was, he was none so glad of it, for my father kept him hard at work copying out all those twelve Buonaparte sermons for the lady\u2014that was for Peter himself, you know. He was the lady. And once when he wanted to go fishing, Peter said, \u2018Confound the woman!\u2019\u2014very bad language, my dear, but Peter was not always so guarded as he should have been; my father was so angry with him, it nearly frightened me out of my wits: and yet I could hardly keep from laughing at the little curtseys Peter kept making, quite slyly, whenever my father spoke of the lady\u2019s excellent taste and sound discrimination.\u201d\n\nConfound the woman\n\n\u201cDid Miss Jenkyns know of these tricks?\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cOh, no! Deborah would have been too much shocked. No, no one knew but me. I wish I had always known of Peter\u2019s plans; but sometimes he did not tell me. He used to say the old ladies in the town wanted something to talk about; but I don\u2019t think they did. They had the St James\u2019s Chronicle three times a week, just as we have now, and we have plenty to say; and I remember the clacking noise there always was when some of the ladies got together. But, probably, schoolboys talk more than ladies. At last there was a terrible, sad thing happened.\u201d Miss Matty got up, went to the door, and opened it; no one was there. She rang the bell for Martha, and when Martha came, her mistress told her to go for eggs to a farm at the other end of the town.\n\n\u201cI will lock the door after you, Martha. You are not afraid to go, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am, not at all; Jem Hearn will be only too proud to go with me.\u201d\n\nMiss Matty drew herself up, and as soon as we were alone, she wished that Martha had more maidenly reserve.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll put out the candle, my dear. We can talk just as well by firelight, you know. There! Well, you see, Deborah had gone from home for a fortnight or so; it was a very still, quiet day, I remember, overhead; and the lilacs were all in flower, so I suppose it was spring. My father had gone out to see some sick people in the parish; I recollect seeing him leave the house with his wig and shovel-hat and cane. What possessed our poor Peter I don\u2019t know; he had the sweetest temper, and yet he always seemed to like to plague Deborah. She never laughed at his jokes, and thought him ungenteel, and not careful enough about improving his mind; and that vexed him.\n\n\u201cWell! he went to her room, it seems, and dressed himself in her old gown, and shawl, and bonnet; just the things she used to wear in Cranford, and was known by everywhere; and he made the pillow into a little\u2014you are sure you locked the door, my dear, for I should not like anyone to hear\u2014into\u2014into a little baby, with white long clothes. It was only, as he told me afterwards, to make something to talk about in the town; he never thought of it as affecting Deborah. And he went and walked up and down in the Filbert walk\u2014just half-hidden by the rails, and half-seen; and he cuddled his pillow, just like a baby, and talked to it all the nonsense people do. Oh dear! and my father came stepping stately up the street, as he always did; and what should he see but a little black crowd of people\u2014I daresay as many as twenty\u2014all peeping through his garden rails. So he thought, at first, they were only looking at a new rhododendron that was in full bloom, and that he was very proud of; and he walked slower, that they might have more time to admire. And he wondered if he could make out a sermon from the occasion, and thought, perhaps, there was some relation between the rhododendrons and the lilies of the field. My poor father! When he came nearer, he began to wonder that they did not see him; but their heads were all so close together, peeping and peeping! My father was amongst them, meaning, he said, to ask them to walk into the garden with him, and admire the beautiful vegetable production, when\u2014oh, my dear, I tremble to think of it\u2014he looked through the rails himself, and saw\u2014I don\u2019t know what he thought he saw, but old Clare told me his face went quite grey-white with anger, and his eyes blazed out under his frowning black brows; and he spoke out\u2014oh, so terribly!\u2014and bade them all stop where they were\u2014not one of them to go, not one of them to stir a step; and, swift as light, he was in at the garden door, and down the Filbert walk, and seized hold of poor Peter, and tore his clothes off his back\u2014bonnet, shawl, gown, and all\u2014and threw the pillow among the people over the railings: and then he was very, very angry indeed, and before all the people he lifted up his cane and flogged Peter!\n\n\u201cMy dear, that boy\u2019s trick, on that sunny day, when all seemed going straight and well, broke my mother\u2019s heart, and changed my father for life. It did, indeed. Old Clare said, Peter looked as white as my father; and stood as still as a statue to be flogged; and my father struck hard! When my father stopped to take breath, Peter said, \u2018Have you done enough, sir?\u2019 quite hoarsely, and still standing quite quiet. I don\u2019t know what my father said\u2014or if he said anything. But old Clare said, Peter turned to where the people outside the railing were, and made them a low bow, as grand and as grave as any gentleman; and then walked slowly into the house. I was in the store-room helping my mother to make cowslip wine. I cannot abide the wine now, nor the scent of the flowers; they turn me sick and faint, as they did that day, when Peter came in, looking as haughty as any man\u2014indeed, looking like a man, not like a boy. \u2018Mother!\u2019 he said, \u2018I am come to say, God bless you for ever.\u2019 I saw his lips quiver as he spoke; and I think he durst not say anything more loving, for the purpose that was in his heart. She looked at him rather frightened, and wondering, and asked him what was to do. He did not smile or speak, but put his arms round her and kissed her as if he did not know how to leave off; and before she could speak again, he was gone. We talked it over, and could not understand it, and she bade me go and seek my father, and ask what it was all about. I found him walking up and down, looking very highly displeased.\n\n\u201c\u2018Tell your mother I have flogged Peter, and that he richly deserved it.\u2019\n\n\u201cI durst not ask any more questions. When I told my mother, she sat down, quite faint, for a minute. I remember, a few days after, I saw the poor, withered cowslip flowers thrown out to the leaf heap, to decay and die there. There was no making of cowslip wine that year at the rectory\u2014nor, indeed, ever after.\n\n\u201cPresently my mother went to my father. I know I thought of Queen Esther and King Ahasuerus; for my mother was very pretty and delicate-looking, and my father looked as terrible as King Ahasuerus. Some time after they came out together; and then my mother told me what had happened, and that she was going up to Peter\u2019s room at my father\u2019s desire\u2014though she was not to tell Peter this\u2014to talk the matter over with him. But no Peter was there. We looked over the house; no Peter was there! Even my father, who had not liked to join in the search at first, helped us before long. The rectory was a very old house\u2014steps up into a room, steps down into a room, all through. At first, my mother went calling low and soft, as if to reassure the poor boy, \u2018Peter! Peter, dear! it\u2019s only me;\u2019 but, by-and-by, as the servants came back from the errands my father had sent them, in different directions, to find where Peter was\u2014as we found he was not in the garden, nor the hayloft, nor anywhere about\u2014my mother\u2019s cry grew louder and wilder, \u2018Peter! Peter, my darling! where are you?\u2019 for then she felt and understood that that long kiss meant some sad kind of \u2018good-bye.\u2019 The afternoon went on\u2014my mother never resting, but seeking again and again in every possible place that had been looked into twenty times before, nay, that she had looked into over and over again herself. My father sat with his head in his hands, not speaking except when his messengers came in, bringing no tidings; then he lifted up his face, so strong and sad, and told them to go again in some new direction. My mother kept passing from room to room, in and out of the house, moving noiselessly, but never ceasing. Neither she nor my father durst leave the house, which was the meeting-place for all the messengers. At last (and it was nearly dark), my father rose up. He took hold of my mother\u2019s arm as she came with wild, sad pace through one door, and quickly towards another. She started at the touch of his hand, for she had forgotten all in the world but Peter.\n\n\u201c\u2018Molly!\u2019 said he, \u2018I did not think all this would happen.\u2019 He looked into her face for comfort\u2014her poor face all wild and white; for neither she nor my father had dared to acknowledge\u2014much less act upon\u2014the terror that was in their hearts, lest Peter should have made away with himself. My father saw no conscious look in his wife\u2019s hot, dreary eyes, and he missed the sympathy that she had always been ready to give him\u2014strong man as he was, and at the dumb despair in her face his tears began to flow. But when she saw this, a gentle sorrow came over her countenance, and she said, \u2018Dearest John! don\u2019t cry; come with me, and we\u2019ll find him,\u2019 almost as cheerfully as if she knew where he was. And she took my father\u2019s great hand in her little soft one, and led him along, the tears dropping as he walked on that same unceasing, weary walk, from room to room, through house and garden.\n\n\u201cOh, how I wished for Deborah! I had no time for crying, for now all seemed to depend on me. I wrote for Deborah to come home. I sent a message privately to that same Mr Holbrook\u2019s house\u2014poor Mr Holbrook;\u2014you know who I mean. I don\u2019t mean I sent a message to him, but I sent one that I could trust to know if Peter was at his house. For at one time Mr Holbrook was an occasional visitor at the rectory\u2014you know he was Miss Pole\u2019s cousin\u2014and he had been very kind to Peter, and taught him how to fish\u2014he was very kind to everybody, and I thought Peter might have gone off there. But Mr Holbrook was from home, and Peter had never been seen. It was night now; but the doors were all wide open, and my father and mother walked on and on; it was more than an hour since he had joined her, and I don\u2019t believe they had ever spoken all that time. I was getting the parlour fire lighted, and one of the servants was preparing tea, for I wanted them to have something to eat and drink and warm them, when old Clare asked to speak to me.\n\n\u201c\u2018I have borrowed the nets from the weir, Miss Matty. Shall we drag the ponds to-night, or wait for the morning?\u2019\n\n\u201cI remember staring in his face to gather his meaning; and when I did, I laughed out loud. The horror of that new thought\u2014our bright, darling Peter, cold, and stark, and dead! I remember the ring of my own laugh now.\n\n\u201cThe next day Deborah was at home before I was myself again. She would not have been so weak as to give way as I had done; but my screams (my horrible laughter had ended in crying) had roused my sweet dear mother, whose poor wandering wits were called back and collected as soon as a child needed her care. She and Deborah sat by my bedside; I knew by the looks of each that there had been no news of Peter\u2014no awful, ghastly news, which was what I most had dreaded in my dull state between sleeping and waking.\n\n\u201cThe same result of all the searching had brought something of the same relief to my mother, to whom, I am sure, the thought that Peter might even then be hanging dead in some of the familiar home places had caused that never-ending walk of yesterday. Her soft eyes never were the same again after that; they had always a restless, craving look, as if seeking for what they could not find. Oh! it was an awful time; coming down like a thunder-bolt on the still sunny day when the lilacs were all in bloom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere was Mr Peter?\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cHe had made his way to Liverpool; and there was war then; and some of the king\u2019s ships lay off the mouth of the Mersey; and they were only too glad to have a fine likely boy such as him (five foot nine he was), come to offer himself. The captain wrote to my father, and Peter wrote to my mother. Stay! those letters will be somewhere here.\u201d\n\nWe lighted the candle, and found the captain\u2019s letter and Peter\u2019s too. And we also found a little simple begging letter from Mrs Jenkyns to Peter, addressed to him at the house of an old schoolfellow whither she fancied he might have gone. They had returned it unopened; and unopened it had remained ever since, having been inadvertently put by among the other letters of that time. This is it:\u2014\n\n\u201cMy dearest Peter,\u2014You did not think we should be so sorry as we are, I know, or you would never have gone away. You are too good. Your father sits and sighs till my heart aches to hear him. He cannot hold up his head for grief; and yet he only did what he thought was right. Perhaps he has been too severe, and perhaps I have not been kind enough; but God knows how we love you, my dear only boy. Don looks so sorry you are gone. Come back, and make us happy, who love you so much. I know you will come back.\u201d\n\nBut Peter did not come back. That spring day was the last time he ever saw his mother\u2019s face. The writer of the letter\u2014the last\u2014the only person who had ever seen what was written in it, was dead long ago; and I, a stranger, not born at the time when this occurrence took place, was the one to open it.\n\nThe captain\u2019s letter summoned the father and mother to Liverpool instantly, if they wished to see their boy; and, by some of the wild chances of life, the captain\u2019s letter had been detained somewhere, somehow.\n\nMiss Matty went on, \u201cAnd it was racetime, and all the post-horses at Cranford were gone to the races; but my father and mother set off in our own gig\u2014and oh! my dear, they were too late\u2014the ship was gone! And now read Peter\u2019s letter to my mother!\u201d\n\nIt was full of love, and sorrow, and pride in his new profession, and a sore sense of his disgrace in the eyes of the people at Cranford; but ending with a passionate entreaty that she would come and see him before he left the Mersey: \u201cMother; we may go into battle. I hope we shall, and lick those French: but I must see you again before that time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she was too late,\u201d said Miss Matty; \u201ctoo late!\u201d\n\nWe sat in silence, pondering on the full meaning of those sad, sad words. At length I asked Miss Matty to tell me how her mother bore it.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d she said, \u201cshe was patience itself. She had never been strong, and this weakened her terribly. My father used to sit looking at her: far more sad than she was. He seemed as if he could look at nothing else when she was by; and he was so humble\u2014so very gentle now. He would, perhaps, speak in his old way\u2014laying down the law, as it were\u2014and then, in a minute or two, he would come round and put his hand on our shoulders, and ask us in a low voice, if he had said anything to hurt us. I did not wonder at his speaking so to Deborah, for she was so clever; but I could not bear to hear him talking so to me.\n\n\u201cBut, you see, he saw what we did not\u2014that it was killing my mother. Yes! killing her (put out the candle, my dear; I can talk better in the dark), for she was but a frail woman, and ill-fitted to stand the fright and shock she had gone through; and she would smile at him and comfort him, not in words, but in her looks and tones, which were always cheerful when he was there. And she would speak of how she thought Peter stood a good chance of being admiral very soon\u2014he was so brave and clever; and how she thought of seeing him in his navy uniform, and what sort of hats admirals wore; and how much more fit he was to be a sailor than a clergyman; and all in that way, just to make my father think she was quite glad of what came of that unlucky morning\u2019s work, and the flogging which was always in his mind, as we all knew. But oh, my dear! the bitter, bitter crying she had when she was alone; and at last, as she grew weaker, she could not keep her tears in when Deborah or me was by, and would give us message after message for Peter (his ship had gone to the Mediterranean, or somewhere down there, and then he was ordered off to India, and there was no overland route then); but she still said that no one knew where their death lay in wait, and that we were not to think hers was near. We did not think it, but we knew it, as we saw her fading away.\n\n\u201cWell, my dear, it\u2019s very foolish of me, I know, when in all likelihood I am so near seeing her again.\n\n\u201cAnd only think, love! the very day after her death\u2014for she did not live quite a twelvemonth after Peter went away\u2014the very day after\u2014came a parcel for her from India\u2014from her poor boy. It was a large, soft, white Indian shawl, with just a little narrow border all round; just what my mother would have liked.\n\n\u201cWe thought it might rouse my father, for he had sat with her hand in his all night long; so Deborah took it in to him, and Peter\u2019s letter to her, and all. At first, he took no notice; and we tried to make a kind of light careless talk about the shawl, opening it out and admiring it. Then, suddenly, he got up, and spoke: \u2018She shall be buried in it,\u2019 he said; \u2018Peter shall have that comfort; and she would have liked it.\u2019\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps it was not reasonable, but what could we do or say? One gives people in grief their own way. He took it up and felt it: \u2018It is just such a shawl as she wished for when she was married, and her mother did not give it her. I did not know of it till after, or she should have had it\u2014she should; but she shall have it now.\u2019\n\n\u201cMy mother looked so lovely in her death! She was always pretty, and now she looked fair, and waxen, and young\u2014younger than Deborah, as she stood trembling and shivering by her. We decked her in the long soft folds; she lay smiling, as if pleased; and people came\u2014all Cranford came\u2014to beg to see her, for they had loved her dearly, as well they might; and the countrywomen brought posies; old Clare\u2019s wife brought some white violets and begged they might lie on her breast.\n\n\u201cDeborah said to me, the day of my mother\u2019s funeral, that if she had a hundred offers she never would marry and leave my father. It was not very likely she would have so many\u2014I don\u2019t know that she had one; but it was not less to her credit to say so. She was such a daughter to my father as I think there never was before or since. His eyes failed him, and she read book after book, and wrote, and copied, and was always at his service in any parish business. She could do many more things than my poor mother could; she even once wrote a letter to the bishop for my father. But he missed my mother sorely; the whole parish noticed it. Not that he was less active; I think he was more so, and more patient in helping every one. I did all I could to set Deborah at liberty to be with him; for I knew I was good for little, and that my best work in the world was to do odd jobs quietly, and set others at liberty. But my father was a changed man.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid Mr Peter ever come home?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, once. He came home a lieutenant; he did not get to be admiral. And he and my father were such friends! My father took him into every house in the parish, he was so proud of him. He never walked out without Peter\u2019s arm to lean upon. Deborah used to smile (I don\u2019t think we ever laughed again after my mother\u2019s death), and say she was quite put in a corner. Not but what my father always wanted her when there was letter-writing or reading to be done, or anything to be settled.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d said I, after a pause.\n\n\u201cThen Peter went to sea again; and, by-and-by, my father died, blessing us both, and thanking Deborah for all she had been to him; and, of course, our circumstances were changed; and, instead of living at the rectory, and keeping three maids and a man, we had to come to this small house, and be content with a servant-of-all-work; but, as Deborah used to say, we have always lived genteelly, even if circumstances have compelled us to simplicity. Poor Deborah!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Mr Peter?\u201d asked I.\n\n\u201cOh, there was some great war in India\u2014I forget what they call it\u2014and we have never heard of Peter since then. I believe he is dead myself; and it sometimes fidgets me that we have never put on mourning for him. And then again, when I sit by myself, and all the house is still, I think I hear his step coming up the street, and my heart begins to flutter and beat; but the sound always goes past\u2014and Peter never comes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Martha back? No! I\u2019ll go, my dear; I can always find my way in the dark, you know. And a blow of fresh air at the door will do my head good, and it\u2019s rather got a trick of aching.\u201d\n\nSo she pattered off. I had lighted the candle, to give the room a cheerful appearance against her return.\n\n\u201cWas it Martha?\u201d asked I.\n\n\u201cYes. And I am rather uncomfortable, for I heard such a strange noise, just as I was opening the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d I asked, for her eyes were round with affright.\n\n\u201cIn the street\u2014just outside\u2014it sounded like\u201d\u2014\n\n\u201cTalking?\u201d I put in, as she hesitated a little.\n\n\u201cNo! kissing\u201d\u2014\nCHAPTER VII.\nVISITING\n\nOne morning, as Miss Matty and I sat at our work\u2014it was before twelve o\u2019clock, and Miss Matty had not changed the cap with yellow ribbons that had been Miss Jenkyns\u2019s best, and which Miss Matty was now wearing out in private, putting on the one made in imitation of Mrs Jamieson\u2019s at all times when she expected to be seen\u2014Martha came up, and asked if Miss Betty Barker might speak to her mistress. Miss Matty assented, and quickly disappeared to change the yellow ribbons, while Miss Barker came upstairs; but, as she had forgotten her spectacles, and was rather flurried by the unusual time of the visit, I was not surprised to see her return with one cap on the top of the other. She was quite unconscious of it herself, and looked at us, with bland satisfaction. Nor do I think Miss Barker perceived it; for, putting aside the little circumstance that she was not so young as she had been, she was very much absorbed in her errand, which she delivered herself of with an oppressive modesty that found vent in endless apologies.\n\nMiss Betty Barker was the daughter of the old clerk at Cranford who had officiated in Mr Jenkyns\u2019s time. She and her sister had had pretty good situations as ladies\u2019 maids, and had saved money enough to set up a milliner\u2019s shop, which had been patronised by the ladies in the neighbourhood. Lady Arley, for instance, would occasionally give Miss Barkers the pattern of an old cap of hers, which they immediately copied and circulated among the \xe9lite of Cranford. I say the \xe9lite, for Miss Barkers had caught the trick of the place, and piqued themselves upon their \u201caristocratic connection.\u201d They would not sell their caps and ribbons to anyone without a pedigree. Many a farmer\u2019s wife or daughter turned away huffed from Miss Barkers\u2019 select millinery, and went rather to the universal shop, where the profits of brown soap and moist sugar enabled the proprietor to go straight to (Paris, he said, until he found his customers too patriotic and John Bullish to wear what the Mounseers wore) London, where, as he often told his customers, Queen Adelaide had appeared, only the very week before, in a cap exactly like the one he showed them, trimmed with yellow and blue ribbons, and had been complimented by King William on the becoming nature of her head-dress.\n\nMiss Barkers, who confined themselves to truth, and did not approve of miscellaneous customers, throve notwithstanding. They were self-denying, good people. Many a time have I seen the eldest of them (she that had been maid to Mrs Jamieson) carrying out some delicate mess to a poor person. They only aped their betters in having \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the class immediately below theirs. And when Miss Barker died, their profits and income were found to be such that Miss Betty was justified in shutting up shop and retiring from business. She also (as I think I have before said) set up her cow; a mark of respectability in Cranford almost as decided as setting up a gig is among some people. She dressed finer than any lady in Cranford; and we did not wonder at it; for it was understood that she was wearing out all the bonnets and caps and outrageous ribbons which had once formed her stock-in-trade. It was five or six years since she had given up shop, so in any other place than Cranford her dress might have been considered pass\xe9e.\n\nAnd now Miss Betty Barker had called to invite Miss Matty to tea at her house on the following Tuesday. She gave me also an impromptu invitation, as I happened to be a visitor\u2014though I could see she had a little fear lest, since my father had gone to live in Drumble, he might have engaged in that \u201chorrid cotton trade,\u201d and so dragged his family down out of \u201caristocratic society.\u201d She prefaced this invitation with so many apologies that she quite excited my curiosity. \u201cHer presumption\u201d was to be excused. What had she been doing? She seemed so overpowered by it I could only think that she had been writing to Queen Adelaide to ask for a receipt for washing lace; but the act which she so characterised was only an invitation she had carried to her sister\u2019s former mistress, Mrs Jamieson. \u201cHer former occupation considered, could Miss Matty excuse the liberty?\u201d Ah! thought I, she has found out that double cap, and is going to rectify Miss Matty\u2019s head-dress. No! it was simply to extend her invitation to Miss Matty and to me. Miss Matty bowed acceptance; and I wondered that, in the graceful action, she did not feel the unusual weight and extraordinary height of her head-dress. But I do not think she did, for she recovered her balance, and went on talking to Miss Betty in a kind, condescending manner, very different from the fidgety way she would have had if she had suspected how singular her appearance was. \u201cMrs Jamieson is coming, I think you said?\u201d asked Miss Matty.\n\n\u201cYes. Mrs Jamieson most kindly and condescendingly said she would be happy to come. One little stipulation she made, that she should bring Carlo. I told her that if I had a weakness, it was for dogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Miss Pole?\u201d questioned Miss Matty, who was thinking of her pool at Preference, in which Carlo would not be available as a partner.\n\n\u201cI am going to ask Miss Pole. Of course, I could not think of asking her until I had asked you, madam\u2014the rector\u2019s daughter, madam. Believe me, I do not forget the situation my father held under yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Mrs Forrester, of course?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Mrs Forrester. I thought, in fact, of going to her before I went to Miss Pole. Although her circumstances are changed, madam, she was born at Tyrrell, and we can never forget her alliance to the Bigges, of Bigelow Hall.\u201d\n\nMiss Matty cared much more for the little circumstance of her being a very good card-player.\n\n\u201cMrs Fitz-Adam\u2014I suppose\u201d\u2014\n\n\u201cNo, madam. I must draw a line somewhere. Mrs Jamieson would not, I think, like to meet Mrs Fitz-Adam. I have the greatest respect for Mrs Fitz-Adam\u2014but I cannot think her fit society for such ladies as Mrs Jamieson and Miss Matilda Jenkyns.\u201d\n\nMiss Betty Barker bowed low to Miss Matty, and pursed up her mouth. She looked at me with sidelong dignity, as much as to say, although a retired milliner, she was no democrat, and understood the difference of ranks.\n\n\u201cMay I beg you to come as near half-past six to my little dwelling, as possible, Miss Matilda? Mrs Jamieson dines at five, but has kindly promised not to delay her visit beyond that time\u2014half-past six.\u201d And with a swimming curtsey Miss Betty Barker took her leave.\n\nMy prophetic soul foretold a visit that afternoon from Miss Pole, who usually came to call on Miss Matilda after any event\u2014or indeed in sight of any event\u2014to talk it over with her.\n\n\u201cMiss Betty told me it was to be a choice and select few,\u201d said Miss Pole, as she and Miss Matty compared notes.\n\n\u201cYes, so she said. Not even Mrs Fitz-Adam.\u201d\n\nNow Mrs Fitz-Adam was the widowed sister of the Cranford surgeon, whom I have named before. Their parents were respectable farmers, content with their station. The name of these good people was Hoggins. Mr Hoggins was the Cranford doctor now; we disliked the name and considered it coarse; but, as Miss Jenkyns said, if he changed it to Piggins it would not be much better. We had hoped to discover a relationship between him and that Marchioness of Exeter whose name was Molly Hoggins; but the man, careless of his own interests, utterly ignored and denied any such relationship, although, as dear Miss Jenkyns had said, he had a sister called Mary, and the same Christian names were very apt to run in families.\n\nSoon after Miss Mary Hoggins married Mr Fitz-Adam, she disappeared from the neighbourhood for many years. She did not move in a sphere in Cranford society sufficiently high to make any of us care to know what Mr Fitz-Adam was. He died and was gathered to his fathers without our ever having thought about him at all. And then Mrs Fitz-Adam reappeared in Cranford (\u201cas bold as a lion,\u201d Miss Pole said), a well-to-do widow, dressed in rustling black silk, so soon after her husband\u2019s death that poor Miss Jenkyns was justified in the remark she made, that \u201cbombazine would have shown a deeper sense of her loss.\u201d\n\nI remember the convocation of ladies who assembled to decide whether or not Mrs Fitz-Adam should be called upon by the old blue-blooded inhabitants of Cranford. She had taken a large rambling house, which had been usually considered to confer a patent of gentility upon its tenant, because, once upon a time, seventy or eighty years before, the spinster daughter of an earl had resided in it. I am not sure if the inhabiting this house was not also believed to convey some unusual power of intellect; for the earl\u2019s daughter, Lady Jane, had a sister, Lady Anne, who had married a general officer in the time of the American war, and this general officer had written one or two comedies, which were still acted on the London boards, and which, when we saw them advertised, made us all draw up, and feel that Drury Lane was paying a very pretty compliment to Cranford. Still, it was not at all a settled thing that Mrs Fitz-Adam was to be visited, when dear Miss Jenkyns died; and, with her, something of the clear knowledge of the strict code of gentility went out too. As Miss Pole observed, \u201cAs most of the ladies of good family in Cranford were elderly spinsters, or widows without children, if we did not relax a little, and become less exclusive, by-and-by we should have no society at all.\u201d\n\nMrs Forrester continued on the same side.\n\n\u201cShe had always understood that Fitz meant something aristocratic; there was Fitz-Roy\u2014she thought that some of the King\u2019s children had been called Fitz-Roy; and there was Fitz-Clarence, now\u2014they were the children of dear good King William the Fourth. Fitz-Adam!\u2014it was a pretty name, and she thought it very probably meant \u2018Child of Adam.\u2019 No one, who had not some good blood in their veins, would dare to be called Fitz; there was a deal in a name\u2014she had had a cousin who spelt his name with two little ffs\u2014ffoulkes\u2014and he always looked down upon capital letters and said they belonged to lately-invented families. She had been afraid he would die a bachelor, he was so very choice. When he met with a Mrs ffarringdon, at a watering-place, he took to her immediately; and a very pretty genteel woman she was\u2014a widow, with a very good fortune; and \u2018my cousin,\u2019 Mr ffoulkes, married her; and it was all owing to her two little ffs.\u201d\n\nMrs Fitz-Adam did not stand a chance of meeting with a Mr Fitz-anything in Cranford, so that could not have been her motive for settling there. Miss Matty thought it might have been the hope of being admitted into the society of the place, which would certainly be a very agreeable rise for ci-devant Miss Hoggins; and if this had been her hope it would be cruel to disappoint her.\n\nSo everybody called upon Mrs Fitz-Adam\u2014everybody but Mrs Jamieson, who used to show how honourable she was by never seeing Mrs Fitz-Adam when they met at the Cranford parties. There would be only eight or ten ladies in the room, and Mrs Fitz-Adam was the largest of all, and she invariably used to stand up when Mrs Jamieson came in, and curtsey very low to her whenever she turned in her direction\u2014so low, in fact, that I think Mrs Jamieson must have looked at the wall above her, for she never moved a muscle of her face, no more than if she had not seen her. Still Mrs Fitz-Adam persevered.\n\nThe spring evenings were getting bright and long when three or four ladies in calashes met at Miss Barker\u2019s door. Do you know what a calash is? It is a covering worn over caps, not unlike the heads fastened on old-fashioned gigs; but sometimes it is not quite so large. This kind of head-gear always made an awful impression on the children in Cranford; and now two or three left off their play in the quiet sunny little street, and gathered in wondering silence round Miss Pole, Miss Matty, and myself. We were silent too, so that we could hear loud, suppressed whispers inside Miss Barker\u2019s house: \u201cWait, Peggy! wait till I\u2019ve run upstairs and washed my hands. When I cough, open the door; I\u2019ll not be a minute.\u201d\n\nAnd, true enough it was not a minute before we heard a noise, between a sneeze and a crow; on which the door flew open. Behind it stood a round-eyed maiden, all aghast at the honourable company of calashes, who marched in without a word. She recovered presence of mind enough to usher us into a small room, which had been the shop, but was now converted into a temporary dressing-room. There we unpinned and shook ourselves, and arranged our features before the glass into a sweet and gracious company-face; and then, bowing backwards with \u201cAfter you, ma\u2019am,\u201d we allowed Mrs Forrester to take precedence up the narrow staircase that led to Miss Barker\u2019s drawing-room. There she sat, as stately and composed as though we had never heard that odd-sounding cough, from which her throat must have been even then sore and rough. Kind, gentle, shabbily-dressed Mrs Forrester was immediately conducted to the second place of honour\u2014a seat arranged something like Prince Albert\u2019s near the Queen\u2019s\u2014good, but not so good. The place of pre-eminence was, of course, reserved for the Honourable Mrs Jamieson, who presently came panting up the stairs\u2014Carlo rushing round her on her progress, as if he meant to trip her up.\n\nAnd now Miss Betty Barker was a proud and happy woman! She stirred the fire, and shut the door, and sat as near to it as she could, quite on the edge of her chair. When Peggy came in, tottering under the weight of the tea-tray, I noticed that Miss Barker was sadly afraid lest Peggy should not keep her distance sufficiently. She and her mistress were on very familiar terms in their every-day intercourse, and Peggy wanted now to make several little confidences to her, which Miss Barker was on thorns to hear, but which she thought it her duty, as a lady, to repress. So she turned away from all Peggy\u2019s asides and signs; but she made one or two very malapropos answers to what was said; and at last, seized with a bright idea, she exclaimed, \u201cPoor, sweet Carlo! I\u2019m forgetting him. Come downstairs with me, poor ittie doggie, and it shall have its tea, it shall!\u201d\n\nIn a few minutes she returned, bland and benignant as before; but I thought she had forgotten to give the \u201cpoor ittie doggie\u201d anything to eat, judging by the avidity with which he swallowed down chance pieces of cake. The tea-tray was abundantly loaded\u2014I was pleased to see it, I was so hungry; but I was afraid the ladies present might think it vulgarly heaped up. I know they would have done at their own houses; but somehow the heaps disappeared here. I saw Mrs Jamieson eating seed-cake, slowly and considerately, as she did everything; and I was rather surprised, for I knew she had told us, on the occasion of her last party, that she never had it in her house, it reminded her so much of scented soap. She always gave us Savoy biscuits. However, Mrs Jamieson was kindly indulgent to Miss Barker\u2019s want of knowledge of the customs of high life; and, to spare her feelings, ate three large pieces of seed-cake, with a placid, ruminating expression of countenance, not unlike a cow\u2019s.\n\nAfter tea there was some little demur and difficulty. We were six in number; four could play at Preference, and for the other two there was Cribbage. But all, except myself (I was rather afraid of the Cranford ladies at cards, for it was the most earnest and serious business they ever engaged in), were anxious to be of the \u201cpool.\u201d Even Miss Barker, while declaring she did not know Spadille from Manille, was evidently hankering to take a hand. The dilemma was soon put an end to by a singular kind of noise. If a baron\u2019s daughter-in-law could ever be supposed to snore, I should have said Mrs Jamieson did so then; for, overcome by the heat of the room, and inclined to doze by nature, the temptation of that very comfortable arm-chair had been too much for her, and Mrs Jamieson was nodding. Once or twice she opened her eyes with an effort, and calmly but unconsciously smiled upon us; but by-and-by, even her benevolence was not equal to this exertion, and she was sound asleep.\n\nThe temptation of the comfortable arm-chair had been too much for her\n\n\u201cIt is very gratifying to me,\u201d whispered Miss Barker at the card-table to her three opponents, whom, notwithstanding her ignorance of the game, she was \u201cbasting\u201d most unmercifully\u2014\u201cvery gratifying indeed, to see how completely Mrs Jamieson feels at home in my poor little dwelling; she could not have paid me a greater compliment.\u201d\n\nMiss Barker provided me with some literature in the shape of three or four handsomely-bound fashion-books ten or twelve years old, observing, as she put a little table and a candle for my especial benefit, that she knew young people liked to look at pictures. Carlo lay and snorted, and started at his mistress\u2019s feet. He, too, was quite at home.\n\nThe card-table was an animated scene to watch; four ladies\u2019 heads, with niddle-noddling caps, all nearly meeting over the middle of the table in their eagerness to whisper quick enough and loud enough: and every now and then came Miss Barker\u2019s \u201cHush, ladies! if you please, hush! Mrs Jamieson is asleep.\u201d\n\nIt was very difficult to steer clear between Mrs Forrester\u2019s deafness and Mrs Jamieson\u2019s sleepiness. But Miss Barker managed her arduous task well. She repeated the whisper to Mrs Forrester, distorting her face considerably, in order to show, by the motions of her lips, what was said; and then she smiled kindly all round at us, and murmured to herself, \u201cVery gratifying, indeed; I wish my poor sister had been alive to see this day.\u201d\n\nPresently the door was thrown wide open; Carlo started to his feet, with a loud snapping bark, and Mrs Jamieson awoke: or, perhaps, she had not been asleep\u2014as she said almost directly, the room had been so light she had been glad to keep her eyes shut, but had been listening with great interest to all our amusing and agreeable conversation. Peggy came in once more, red with importance. Another tray! \u201cOh, gentility!\u201d thought I, \u201ccan you endure this last shock?\u201d For Miss Barker had ordered (nay, I doubt not, prepared, although she did say, \u201cWhy, Peggy, what have you brought us?\u201d and looked pleasantly surprised at the unexpected pleasure) all sorts of good things for supper\u2014scalloped oysters, potted lobsters, jelly, a dish called \u201clittle Cupids\u201d (which was in great favour with the Cranford ladies, although too expensive to be given, except on solemn and state occasions\u2014macaroons sopped in brandy, I should have called it, if I had not known its more refined and classical name). In short, we were evidently to be feasted with all that was sweetest and best; and we thought it better to submit graciously, even at the cost of our gentility\u2014which never ate suppers in general, but which, like most non-supper-eaters, was particularly hungry on all special occasions.\n\nMiss Barker, in her former sphere, had, I daresay, been made acquainted with the beverage they call cherry-brandy. We none of us had ever seen such a thing, and rather shrank back when she proffered it us\u2014\u201cjust a little, leetle glass, ladies; after the oysters and lobsters, you know. Shell-fish are sometimes thought not very wholesome.\u201d We all shook our heads like female mandarins; but, at last, Mrs Jamieson suffered herself to be persuaded, and we followed her lead. It was not exactly unpalatable, though so hot and so strong that we thought ourselves bound to give evidence that we were not accustomed to such things by coughing terribly\u2014almost as strangely as Miss Barker had done, before we were admitted by Peggy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very strong,\u201d said Miss Pole, as she put down her empty glass; \u201cI do believe there\u2019s spirit in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly a little drop\u2014just necessary to make it keep,\u201d said Miss Barker. \u201cYou know we put brandy-pepper over our preserves to make them keep. I often feel tipsy myself from eating damson tart.\u201d\n\nI question whether damson tart would have opened Mrs Jamieson\u2019s heart as the cherry-brandy did; but she told us of a coming event, respecting which she had been quite silent till that moment.\n\n\u201cMy sister-in-law, Lady Glenmire, is coming to stay with me.\u201d\n\nThere was a chorus of \u201cIndeed!\u201d and then a pause. Each one rapidly reviewed her wardrobe, as to its fitness to appear in the presence of a baron\u2019s widow; for, of course, a series of small festivals were always held in Cranford on the arrival of a visitor at any of our friends\u2019 houses. We felt very pleasantly excited on the present occasion.\n\nNot long after this the maids and the lanterns were announced. Mrs Jamieson had the sedan-chair, which had squeezed itself into Miss Barker\u2019s narrow lobby with some difficulty, and most literally \u201cstopped the way.\u201d It required some skilful manoeuvring on the part of the old chairmen (shoemakers by day, but when summoned to carry the sedan dressed up in a strange old livery\u2014long great-coats, with small capes, coeval with the sedan, and similar to the dress of the class in Hogarth\u2019s pictures) to edge, and back, and try at it again, and finally to succeed in carrying their burden out of Miss Barker\u2019s front door. Then we heard their quick pit-a-pat along the quiet little street as we put on our calashes and pinned up our gowns; Miss Barker hovering about us with offers of help, which, if she had not remembered her former occupation, and wished us to forget it, would have been much more pressing.\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\u201cYOUR LADYSHIP\u201d\n\nEarly the next morning\u2014directly after twelve\u2014Miss Pole made her appearance at Miss Matty\u2019s. Some very trifling piece of business was alleged as a reason for the call; but there was evidently something behind. At last out it came.\n\n\u201cBy the way, you\u2019ll think I\u2019m strangely ignorant; but, do you really know, I am puzzled how we ought to address Lady Glenmire. Do you say, \u2018Your Ladyship,\u2019 where you would say \u2018you\u2019 to a common person? I have been puzzling all morning; and are we to say \u2018My Lady,\u2019 instead of \u2018Ma\u2019am?\u2019 Now you knew Lady Arley\u2014will you kindly tell me the most correct way of speaking to the peerage?\u201d\n\nPoor Miss Matty! she took off her spectacles and she put them on again\u2014but how Lady Arley was addressed, she could not remember.\n\n\u201cIt is so long ago,\u201d she said. \u201cDear! dear! how stupid I am! I don\u2019t think I ever saw her more than twice. I know we used to call Sir Peter, \u2018Sir Peter\u2019\u2014but he came much oftener to see us than Lady Arley did. Deborah would have known in a minute. \u2018My lady\u2019\u2014\u2018your ladyship.\u2019 It sounds very strange, and as if it was not natural. I never thought of it before; but, now you have named it, I am all in a puzzle.\u201d\n\nIt was very certain Miss Pole would obtain no wise decision from Miss Matty, who got more bewildered every moment, and more perplexed as to etiquettes of address.\n\n\u201cWell, I really think,\u201d said Miss Pole, \u201cI had better just go and tell Mrs Forrester about our little difficulty. One sometimes grows nervous; and yet one would not have Lady Glenmire think we were quite ignorant of the etiquettes of high life in Cranford.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd will you just step in here, dear Miss Pole, as you come back, please, and tell me what you decide upon? Whatever you and Mrs Forrester fix upon, will be quite right, I\u2019m sure. \u2018Lady Arley,\u2019 \u2018Sir Peter,\u2019\u201d said Miss Matty to herself, trying to recall the old forms of words.\n\n\u201cWho is Lady Glenmire?\u201d asked I.\n\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s the widow of Mr Jamieson\u2014that\u2019s Mrs Jamieson\u2019s late husband, you know\u2014widow of his eldest brother. Mrs Jamieson was a Miss Walker, daughter of Governor Walker. \u2018Your ladyship.\u2019 My dear, if they fix on that way of speaking, you must just let me practice a little on you first, for I shall feel so foolish and hot saying it the first time to Lady Glenmire.\u201d\n\nIt was really a relief to Miss Matty when Mrs Jamieson came on a very unpolite errand. I notice that apathetic people have more quiet impertinence than others; and Mrs Jamieson came now to insinuate pretty plainly that she did not particularly wish that the Cranford ladies should call upon her sister-in-law. I can hardly say how she made this clear; for I grew very indignant and warm, while with slow deliberation she was explaining her wishes to Miss Matty, who, a true lady herself, could hardly understand the feeling which made Mrs Jamieson wish to appear to her noble sister-in-law as if she only visited \u201ccounty\u201d families. Miss Matty remained puzzled and perplexed long after I had found out the object of Mrs Jamieson\u2019s visit.\n\nWhen she did understand the drift of the honourable lady\u2019s call, it was pretty to see with what quiet dignity she received the intimation thus uncourteously given. She was not in the least hurt\u2014she was of too gentle a spirit for that; nor was she exactly conscious of disapproving of Mrs Jamieson\u2019s conduct; but there was something of this feeling in her mind, I am sure, which made her pass from the subject to others in a less flurried and more composed manner than usual. Mrs Jamieson was, indeed, the more flurried of the two, and I could see she was glad to take her leave.\n\nA little while afterwards Miss Pole returned, red and indignant. \u201cWell! to be sure! You\u2019ve had Mrs Jamieson here, I find from Martha; and we are not to call on Lady Glenmire. Yes! I met Mrs Jamieson, half-way between here and Mrs Forrester\u2019s, and she told me; she took me so by surprise, I had nothing to say. I wish I had thought of something very sharp and sarcastic; I dare say I shall to-night. And Lady Glenmire is but the widow of a Scotch baron after all! I went on to look at Mrs Forrester\u2019s Peerage, to see who this lady was, that is to be kept under a glass case: widow of a Scotch peer\u2014never sat in the House of Lords\u2014and as poor as Job, I dare say; and she\u2014fifth daughter of some Mr Campbell or other. You are the daughter of a rector, at any rate, and related to the Arleys; and Sir Peter might have been Viscount Arley, every one says.\u201d\n\nMiss Matty tried to soothe Miss Pole, but in vain. That lady, usually so kind and good-humoured, was now in a full flow of anger.\n\n\u201cAnd I went and ordered a cap this morning, to be quite ready,\u201d said she at last, letting out the secret which gave sting to Mrs Jamieson\u2019s intimation. \u201cMrs Jamieson shall see if it is so easy to get me to make fourth at a pool when she has none of her fine Scotch relations with her!\u201d\n\nIn coming out of church, the first Sunday on which Lady Glenmire appeared in Cranford, we sedulously talked together, and turned our backs on Mrs Jamieson and her guest. If we might not call on her, we would not even look at her, though we were dying with curiosity to know what she was like. We had the comfort of questioning Martha in the afternoon. Martha did not belong to a sphere of society whose observation could be an implied compliment to Lady Glenmire, and Martha had made good use of her eyes.\n\n\u201cWell, ma\u2019am! is it the little lady with Mrs Jamieson, you mean? I thought you would like more to know how young Mrs Smith was dressed; her being a bride.\u201d (Mrs Smith was the butcher\u2019s wife).\n\nMiss Pole said, \u201cGood gracious me! as if we cared about a Mrs Smith;\u201d but was silent as Martha resumed her speech.\n\n\u201cThe little lady in Mrs Jamieson\u2019s pew had on, ma\u2019am, rather an old black silk, and a shepherd\u2019s plaid cloak, ma\u2019am, and very bright black eyes she had, ma\u2019am, and a pleasant, sharp face; not over young, ma\u2019am, but yet, I should guess, younger than Mrs Jamieson herself. She looked up and down the church, like a bird, and nipped up her petticoats, when she came out, as quick and sharp as ever I see. I\u2019ll tell you what, ma\u2019am, she\u2019s more like Mrs Deacon, at the \u2018Coach and Horses,\u2019 nor any one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHush, Martha!\u201d said Miss Matty, \u201cthat\u2019s not respectful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it, ma\u2019am? I beg pardon, I\u2019m sure; but Jem Hearn said so as well. He said, she was just such a sharp, stirring sort of a body\u201d\u2014\n\n\u201cLady,\u201d said Miss Pole.\n\n\u201cLady\u2014as Mrs Deacon.\u201d\n\nAnother Sunday passed away, and we still averted our eyes from Mrs Jamieson and her guest, and made remarks to ourselves that we thought were very severe\u2014almost too much so. Miss Matty was evidently uneasy at our sarcastic manner of speaking.\n\nPerhaps by this time Lady Glenmire had found out that Mrs Jamieson\u2019s was not the gayest, liveliest house in the world; perhaps Mrs Jamieson had found out that most of the county families were in London, and that those who remained in the country were not so alive as they might have been to the circumstance of Lady Glenmire being in their neighbourhood. Great events spring out of small causes; so I will not pretend to say what induced Mrs Jamieson to alter her determination of excluding the Cranford ladies, and send notes of invitation all round for a small party on the following Tuesday. Mr Mulliner himself brought them round. He would always ignore the fact of there being a back door to any house, and gave a louder rat-tat than his mistress, Mrs Jamieson. He had three little notes, which he carried in a large basket, in order to impress his mistress with an idea of their great weight, though they might easily have gone into his waistcoat pocket.\n\nMiss Matty and I quietly decided that we would have a previous engagement at home: it was the evening on which Miss Matty usually made candle-lighters of all the notes and letters of the week; for on Mondays her accounts were always made straight\u2014not a penny owing from the week before; so, by a natural arrangement, making candle-lighters fell upon a Tuesday evening, and gave us a legitimate excuse for declining Mrs Jamieson\u2019s invitation. But before our answer was written, in came Miss Pole, with an open note in her hand.\n\n\u201cSo!\u201d she said. \u201cAh! I see you have got your note, too. Better late than never. I could have told my Lady Glenmire she would be glad enough of our society before a fortnight was over.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Miss Matty, \u201cwe\u2019re asked for Tuesday evening. And perhaps you would just kindly bring your work across and drink tea with us that night. It is my usual regular time for looking over the last week\u2019s bills, and notes, and letters, and making candle-lighters of them; but that does not seem quite reason enough for saying I have a previous engagement at home, though I meant to make it do. Now, if you would come, my conscience would be quite at ease, and luckily the note is not written yet.\u201d\n\nI saw Miss Pole\u2019s countenance change while Miss Matty was speaking.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you mean to go then?\u201d asked she.\n\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d said, Miss Matty quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t either, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Miss Pole. \u201cYes, I think I do,\u201d said she, rather briskly; and on seeing Miss Matty look surprised, she added, \u201cYou see, one would not like Mrs Jamieson to think that anything she could do, or say, was of consequence enough to give offence; it would be a kind of letting down of ourselves, that I, for one, should not like. It would be too flattering to Mrs Jamieson if we allowed her to suppose that what she had said affected us a week, nay ten days afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell! I suppose it is wrong to be hurt and annoyed so long about anything; and, perhaps, after all, she did not mean to vex us. But I must say, I could not have brought myself to say the things Mrs Jamieson did about our not calling. I really don\u2019t think I shall go.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come! Miss Matty, you must go; you know our friend Mrs Jamieson is much more phlegmatic than most people, and does not enter into the little delicacies of feeling which you possess in so remarkable a degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you possessed them, too, that day Mrs Jamieson called to tell us not to go,\u201d said Miss Matty innocently.\n\nBut Miss Pole, in addition to her delicacies of feeling, possessed a very smart cap, which she was anxious to show to an admiring world; and so she seemed to forget all her angry words uttered not a fortnight before, and to be ready to act on what she called the great Christian principle of \u201cForgive and forget\u201d; and she lectured dear Miss Matty so long on this head that she absolutely ended by assuring her it was her duty, as a deceased rector\u2019s daughter, to buy a new cap and go to the party at Mrs Jamieson\u2019s. So \u201cwe were most happy to accept,\u201d instead of \u201cregretting that we were obliged to decline.\u201d\n\nMr Mulliner\n\nThe expenditure on dress in Cranford was principally in that one article referred to. If the heads were buried in smart new caps, the ladies were like ostriches, and cared not what became of their bodies. Old gowns, white and venerable collars, any number of brooches, up and down and everywhere (some with dogs\u2019 eyes painted in them; some that were like small picture-frames with mausoleums and weeping-willows neatly executed in hair inside; some, again, with miniatures of ladies and gentlemen sweetly smiling out of a nest of stiff muslin), old brooches for a permanent ornament, and new caps to suit the fashion of the day\u2014the ladies of Cranford always dressed with chaste elegance and propriety, as Miss Barker once prettily expressed it.\n\nAnd with three new caps, and a greater array of brooches than had ever been seen together at one time since Cranford was a town, did Mrs Forrester, and Miss Matty, and Miss Pole appear on that memorable Tuesday evening. I counted seven brooches myself on Miss Pole\u2019s dress. Two were fixed negligently in her cap (one was a butterfly made of Scotch pebbles, which a vivid imagination might believe to be the real insect); one fastened her net neckerchief; one her collar; one ornamented the front of her gown, midway between her throat and waist; and another adorned the point of her stomacher. Where the seventh was I have forgotten, but it was somewhere about her, I am sure.\n\nBut I am getting on too fast, in describing the dresses of the company. I should first relate the gathering on the way to Mrs Jamieson\u2019s. That lady lived in a large house just outside the town. A road which had known what it was to be a street ran right before the house, which opened out upon it without any intervening garden or court. Whatever the sun was about, he never shone on the front of that house. To be sure, the living-rooms were at the back, looking on to a pleasant garden; the front windows only belonged to kitchens and housekeepers\u2019 rooms, and pantries, and in one of them Mr Mulliner was reported to sit. Indeed, looking askance, we often saw the back of a head covered with hair powder, which also extended itself over his coat-collar down to his very waist; and this imposing back was always engaged in reading the St James\u2019s Chronicle, opened wide, which, in some degree, accounted for the length of time the said newspaper was in reaching us\u2014equal subscribers with Mrs Jamieson, though, in right of her honourableness, she always had the reading of it first. This very Tuesday, the delay in forwarding the last number had been particularly aggravating; just when both Miss Pole and Miss Matty, the former more especially, had been wanting to see it, in order to coach up the Court news ready for the evening\u2019s interview with aristocracy. Miss Pole told us she had absolutely taken time by the forelock, and been dressed by five o\u2019clock, in order to be ready if the St James\u2019s Chronicle should come in at the last moment\u2014the very St James\u2019s Chronicle which the powdered head was tranquilly and composedly reading as we passed the accustomed window this evening.\n\n\u201cThe impudence of the man!\u201d said Miss Pole, in a low indignant whisper. \u201cI should like to ask him whether his mistress pays her quarter-share for his exclusive use.\u201d\n\nWe looked at her in admiration of the courage of her thought; for Mr Mulliner was an object of great awe to all of us. He seemed never to have forgotten his condescension in coming to live at Cranford. Miss Jenkyns, at times, had stood forth as the undaunted champion of her sex, and spoken to him on terms of equality; but even Miss Jenkyns could get no higher. In his pleasantest and most gracious moods he looked like a sulky cockatoo. He did not speak except in gruff monosyllables. He would wait in the hall when we begged him not to wait, and then look deeply offended because we had kept him there, while, with trembling, hasty hands we prepared ourselves for appearing in company.\n\nMiss Pole ventured on a small joke as we went upstairs, intended, though addressed to us, to afford Mr Mulliner some slight amusement. We all smiled, in order to seem as if we felt at our ease, and timidly looked for Mr Mulliner\u2019s sympathy. Not a muscle of that wooden face had relaxed; and we were grave in an instant.\n\nMrs Jamieson\u2019s drawing-room was cheerful; the evening sun came streaming into it, and the large square window was clustered round with flowers. The furniture was white and gold; not the later style, Louis Quatorze, I think they call it, all shells and twirls; no, Mrs Jamieson\u2019s chairs and tables had not a curve or bend about them. The chair and table legs diminished as they neared the ground, and were straight and square in all their corners. The chairs were all a-row against the walls, with the exception of four or five which stood in a circle round the fire. They were railed with white bars across the back and knobbed with gold; neither the railings nor the knobs invited to ease. There was a japanned table devoted to literature, on which lay a Bible, a Peerage, and a Prayer-Book. There was another square Pembroke table dedicated to the Fine Arts, on which were a kaleidoscope, conversation-cards, puzzle-cards (tied together to an interminable length with faded pink satin ribbon), and a box painted in fond imitation of the drawings which decorate tea-chests. Carlo lay on the worsted-worked rug, and ungraciously barked at us as we entered. Mrs Jamieson stood up, giving us each a torpid smile of welcome, and looking helplessly beyond us at Mr Mulliner, as if she hoped he would place us in chairs, for, if he did not, she never could. I suppose he thought we could find our way to the circle round the fire, which reminded me of Stonehenge, I don\u2019t know why. Lady Glenmire came to the rescue of our hostess, and, somehow or other, we found ourselves for the first time placed agreeably, and not formally, in Mrs Jamieson\u2019s house. Lady Glenmire, now we had time to look at her, proved to be a bright little woman of middle age, who had been very pretty in the days of her youth, and who was even yet very pleasant-looking. I saw Miss Pole appraising her dress in the first five minutes, and I take her word when she said the next day\u2014\n\n\u201cMy dear! ten pounds would have purchased every stitch she had on\u2014lace and all.\u201d\n\nIt was pleasant to suspect that a peeress could be poor, and partly reconciled us to the fact that her husband had never sat in the House of Lords; which, when we first heard of it, seemed a kind of swindling us out of our prospects on false pretences; a sort of \u201cA Lord and No Lord\u201d business.\n\nWe were all very silent at first. We were thinking what we could talk about, that should be high enough to interest My Lady. There had been a rise in the price of sugar, which, as preserving-time was near, was a piece of intelligence to all our house-keeping hearts, and would have been the natural topic if Lady Glenmire had not been by. But we were not sure if the peerage ate preserves\u2014much less knew how they were made. At last, Miss Pole, who had always a great deal of courage and savoir faire, spoke to Lady Glenmire, who on her part had seemed just as much puzzled to know how to break the silence as we were.\n\n\u201cHas your ladyship been to Court lately?\u201d asked she; and then gave a little glance round at us, half timid and half triumphant, as much as to say, \u201cSee how judiciously I have chosen a subject befitting the rank of the stranger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never was there in my life,\u201d said Lady Glenmire, with a broad Scotch accent, but in a very sweet voice. And then, as if she had been too abrupt, she added: \u201cWe very seldom went to London\u2014only twice, in fact, during all my married life; and before I was married my father had far too large a family\u201d (fifth daughter of Mr Campbell was in all our minds, I am sure) \u201cto take us often from our home, even to Edinburgh. Ye\u2019ll have been in Edinburgh, maybe?\u201d said she, suddenly brightening up with the hope of a common interest. We had none of us been there; but Miss Pole had an uncle who once had passed a night there, which was very pleasant.\n\nMrs Jamieson, meanwhile, was absorbed in wonder why Mr Mulliner did not bring the tea; and at length the wonder oozed out of her mouth.\n\n\u201cI had better ring the bell, my dear, had not I?\u201d said Lady Glenmire briskly.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014I think not\u2014Mulliner does not like to be hurried.\u201d\n\nWe should have liked our tea, for we dined at an earlier hour than Mrs Jamieson. I suspect Mr Mulliner had to finish the St James\u2019s Chronicle before he chose to trouble himself about tea. His mistress fidgeted and fidgeted, and kept saying, \u201cI can\u2019t think why Mulliner does not bring tea. I can\u2019t think what he can be about.\u201d And Lady Glenmire at last grew quite impatient, but it was a pretty kind of impatience after all; and she rang the bell rather sharply, on receiving a half-permission from her sister-in-law to do so. Mr Mulliner appeared in dignified surprise. \u201cOh!\u201d said Mrs Jamieson, \u201cLady Glenmire rang the bell; I believe it was for tea.\u201d\n\nIn a few minutes tea was brought. Very delicate was the china, very old the plate, very thin the bread and butter, and very small the lumps of sugar. Sugar was evidently Mrs Jamieson\u2019s favourite economy. I question if the little filigree sugar-tongs, made something like scissors, could have opened themselves wide enough to take up an honest, vulgar good-sized piece; and when I tried to seize two little minnikin pieces at once, so as not to be detected in too many returns to the sugar-basin, they absolutely dropped one, with a little sharp clatter, quite in a malicious and unnatural manner. But before this happened we had had a slight disappointment. In the little silver jug was cream, in the larger one was milk. As soon as Mr Mulliner came in, Carlo began to beg, which was a thing our manners forbade us to do, though I am sure we were just as hungry; and Mrs Jamieson said she was certain we would excuse her if she gave her poor dumb Carlo his tea first. She accordingly mixed a saucerful for him, and put it down for him to lap; and then she told us how intelligent and sensible the dear little fellow was; he knew cream quite well, and constantly refused tea with only milk in it: so the milk was left for us; but we silently thought we were quite as intelligent and sensible as Carlo, and felt as if insult were added to injury when we were called upon to admire the gratitude evinced by his wagging his tail for the cream which should have been ours.\n\nAfter tea we thawed down into common-life subjects. We were thankful to Lady Glenmire for having proposed some more bread and butter, and this mutual want made us better acquainted with her than we should ever have been with talking about the Court, though Miss Pole did say she had hoped to know how the dear Queen was from some one who had seen her.\n\nThe friendship begun over bread and butter extended on to cards. Lady Glenmire played Preference to admiration, and was a complete authority as to Ombre and Quadrille. Even Miss Pole quite forgot to say \u201cmy lady,\u201d and \u201cyour ladyship,\u201d and said \u201cBasto! ma\u2019am\u201d; \u201cyou have Spadille, I believe,\u201d just as quietly as if we had never held the great Cranford Parliament on the subject of the proper mode of addressing a peeress.\n\nAs a proof of how thoroughly we had forgotten that we were in the presence of one who might have sat down to tea with a coronet, instead of a cap, on her head, Mrs Forrester related a curious little fact to Lady Glenmire\u2014an anecdote known to the circle of her intimate friends, but of which even Mrs Jamieson was not aware. It related to some fine old lace, the sole relic of better days, which Lady Glenmire was admiring on Mrs Forrester\u2019s collar.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said that lady, \u201csuch lace cannot be got now for either love or money; made by the nuns abroad, they tell me. They say that they can\u2019t make it now even there. But perhaps they can, now they\u2019ve passed the Catholic Emancipation Bill. I should not wonder. But, in the meantime, I treasure up my lace very much. I daren\u2019t even trust the washing of it to my maid\u201d (the little charity school-girl I have named before, but who sounded well as \u201cmy maid\u201d). \u201cI always wash it myself. And once it had a narrow escape. Of course, your ladyship knows that such lace must never be starched or ironed. Some people wash it in sugar and water, and some in coffee, to make it the right yellow colour; but I myself have a very good receipt for washing it in milk, which stiffens it enough, and gives it a very good creamy colour. Well, ma\u2019am, I had tacked it together (and the beauty of this fine lace is that, when it is wet, it goes into a very little space), and put it to soak in milk, when, unfortunately, I left the room; on my return, I found pussy on the table, looking very like a thief, but gulping very uncomfortably, as if she was half-chocked with something she wanted to swallow and could not. And, would you believe it? At first I pitied her, and said \u2018Poor pussy! poor pussy!\u2019 till, all at once, I looked and saw the cup of milk empty\u2014cleaned out! \u2018You naughty cat!\u2019 said I, and I believe I was provoked enough to give her a slap, which did no good, but only helped the lace down\u2014just as one slaps a choking child on the back. I could have cried, I was so vexed; but I determined I would not give the lace up without a struggle for it. I hoped the lace might disagree with her, at any rate; but it would have been too much for Job, if he had seen, as I did, that cat come in, quite placid and purring, not a quarter of an hour after, and almost expecting to be stroked. \u2018No, pussy!\u2019 said I, \u2018if you have any conscience you ought not to expect that!\u2019 And then a thought struck me; and I rang the bell for my maid, and sent her to Mr Hoggins, with my compliments, and would he be kind enough to lend me one of his top-boots for an hour? I did not think there was anything odd in the message; but Jenny said the young men in the surgery laughed as if they would be ill at my wanting a top-boot. When it came, Jenny and I put pussy in, with her forefeet straight down, so that they were fastened, and could not scratch, and we gave her a teaspoonful of current-jelly in which (your ladyship must excuse me) I had mixed some tartar emetic. I shall never forget how anxious I was for the next half-hour. I took pussy to my own room, and spread a clean towel on the floor. I could have kissed her when she returned the lace to sight, very much as it had gone down. Jenny had boiling water ready, and we soaked it and soaked it, and spread it on a lavender-bush in the sun before I could touch it again, even to put it in milk. But now your ladyship would never guess that it had been in pussy\u2019s inside.\u201d\n\nWe gave her a teaspoonful of current-jelly\n\nWe found out, in the course of the evening, that Lady Glenmire was going to pay Mrs Jamieson a long visit, as she had given up her apartments in Edinburgh, and had no ties to take her back there in a hurry. On the whole, we were rather glad to hear this, for she had made a pleasant impression upon us; and it was also very comfortable to find, from things which dropped out in the course of conversation, that, in addition to many other genteel qualities, she was far removed from the \u201cvulgarity of wealth.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you find it very unpleasant walking?\u201d asked Mrs Jamieson, as our respective servants were announced. It was a pretty regular question from Mrs Jamieson, who had her own carriage in the coach-house, and always went out in a sedan-chair to the very shortest distances. The answers were nearly as much a matter of course.\n\n\u201cOh dear, no! it is so pleasant and still at night!\u201d \u201cSuch a refreshment after the excitement of a party!\u201d \u201cThe stars are so beautiful!\u201d This last was from Miss Matty.\n\n\u201cAre you fond of astronomy?\u201d Lady Glenmire asked.\n\n\u201cNot very,\u201d replied Miss Matty, rather confused at the moment to remember which was astronomy and which was astrology\u2014but the answer was true under either circumstance, for she read, and was slightly alarmed at Francis Moore\u2019s astrological predictions; and, as to astronomy, in a private and confidential conversation, she had told me she never could believe that the earth was moving constantly, and that she would not believe it if she could, it made her feel so tired and dizzy whenever she thought about it.\n\nIn our pattens we picked our way home with extra care that night, so refined and delicate were our perceptions after drinking tea with \u201cmy lady.\u201d\nCHAPTER IX.\nSIGNOR BRUNONI\n\nSoon after the events of which I gave an account in my last paper, I was summoned home by my father\u2019s illness; and for a time I forgot, in anxiety about him, to wonder how my dear friends at Cranford were getting on, or how Lady Glenmire could reconcile herself to the dulness of the long visit which she was still paying to her sister-in-law, Mrs Jamieson. When my father grew a little stronger I accompanied him to the seaside, so that altogether I seemed banished from Cranford, and was deprived of the opportunity of hearing any chance intelligence of the dear little town for the greater part of that year.\n\nLate in November\u2014when we had returned home again, and my father was once more in good health\u2014I received a letter from Miss Matty; and a very mysterious letter it was. She began many sentences without ending them, running them one into another, in much the same confused sort of way in which written words run together on blotting-paper. All I could make out was that, if my father was better (which she hoped he was), and would take warning and wear a great-coat from Michaelmas to Lady-day, if turbans were in fashion, could I tell her? Such a piece of gaiety was going to happen as had not been seen or known of since Wombwell\u2019s lions came, when one of them ate a little child\u2019s arm; and she was, perhaps, too old to care about dress, but a new cap she must have; and, having heard that turbans were worn, and some of the county families likely to come, she would like to look tidy, if I would bring her a cap from the milliner I employed; and oh, dear! how careless of her to forget that she wrote to beg I would come and pay her a visit next Tuesday; when she hoped to have something to offer me in the way of amusement, which she would not now more particularly describe, only sea-green was her favourite colour. So she ended her letter; but in a P.S. she added, she thought she might as well tell me what was the peculiar attraction to Cranford just now; Signor Brunoni was going to exhibit his wonderful magic in the Cranford Assembly Rooms on Wednesday and Friday evening in the following week.\n\nI was very glad to accept the invitation from my dear Miss Matty, independently of the conjuror, and most particularly anxious to prevent her from disfiguring her small, gentle, mousey face with a great Saracen\u2019s head turban; and accordingly, I bought her a pretty, neat, middle-aged cap, which, however, was rather a disappointment to her when, on my arrival, she followed me into my bedroom, ostensibly to poke the fire, but in reality, I do believe, to see if the sea-green turban was not inside the cap-box with which I had travelled. It was in vain that I twirled the cap round on my hand to exhibit back and side fronts: her heart had been set upon a turban, and all she could do was to say, with resignation in her look and voice\u2014\n\n\u201cI am sure you did your best, my dear. It is just like the caps all the ladies in Cranford are wearing, and they have had theirs for a year, I dare say. I should have liked something newer, I confess\u2014something more like the turbans Miss Betty Barker tells me Queen Adelaide wears; but it is very pretty, my dear. And I dare say lavender will wear better than sea-green. Well, after all, what is dress, that we should care anything about it? You\u2019ll tell me if you want anything, my dear. Here is the bell. I suppose turbans have not got down to Drumble yet?\u201d\n\nSo saying, the dear old lady gently bemoaned herself out of the room, leaving me to dress for the evening, when, as she informed me, she expected Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester, and she hoped I should not feel myself too much tired to join the party. Of course I should not; and I made some haste to unpack and arrange my dress; but, with all my speed, I heard the arrivals and the buzz of conversation in the next room before I was ready. Just as I opened the door, I caught the words, \u201cI was foolish to expect anything very genteel out of the Drumble shops; poor girl! she did her best, I\u2019ve no doubt.\u201d But, for all that, I had rather that she blamed Drumble and me than disfigured herself with a turban.\n\nMiss Pole was always the person, in the trio of Cranford ladies now assembled, to have had adventures. She was in the habit of spending the morning in rambling from shop to shop, not to purchase anything (except an occasional reel of cotton or a piece of tape), but to see the new articles and report upon them, and to collect all the stray pieces of intelligence in the town. She had a way, too, of demurely popping hither and thither into all sorts of places to gratify her curiosity on any point\u2014a way which, if she had not looked so very genteel and prim, might have been considered impertinent. And now, by the expressive way in which she cleared her throat, and waited for all minor subjects (such as caps and turbans) to be cleared off the course, we knew she had something very particular to relate, when the due pause came\u2014and I defy any people possessed of common modesty to keep up a conversation long, where one among them sits up aloft in silence, looking down upon all the things they chance to say as trivial and contemptible compared to what they could disclose, if properly entreated. Miss Pole began\u2014\n\n\u201cAs I was stepping out of Gordon\u2019s shop to-day, I chanced to go into the \u2018George\u2019 (my Betty has a second-cousin who is chambermaid there, and I thought Betty would like to hear how she was), and, not seeing anyone about, I strolled up the staircase, and found myself in the passage leading to the Assembly Room (you and I remember the Assembly Room, I am sure, Miss Matty! and the minuets de la cour!); so I went on, not thinking of what I was about, when, all at once, I perceived that I was in the middle of the preparations for to-morrow night\u2014the room being divided with great clothes-maids, over which Crosby\u2019s men were tacking red flannel; very dark and odd it seemed; it quite bewildered me, and I was going on behind the screens, in my absence of mind, when a gentleman (quite the gentleman, I can assure you) stepped forwards and asked if I had any business he could arrange for me. He spoke such pretty broken English, I could not help thinking of Thaddeus of Warsaw, and the Hungarian Brothers, and Santo Sebastiani; and while I was busy picturing his past life to myself, he had bowed me out of the room. But wait a minute! You have not heard half my story yet! I was going downstairs, when who should I meet but Betty\u2019s second-cousin. So, of course, I stopped to speak to her for Betty\u2019s sake; and she told me that I had really seen the conjuror\u2014the gentleman who spoke broken English was Signor Brunoni himself. Just at this moment he passed us on the stairs, making such a graceful bow! in reply to which I dropped a curtsey\u2014all foreigners have such polite manners, one catches something of it. But when he had gone downstairs, I bethought me that I had dropped my glove in the Assembly Room (it was safe in my muff all the time, but I never found it till afterwards); so I went back, and, just as I was creeping up the passage left on one side of the great screen that goes nearly across the room, who should I see but the very same gentleman that had met me before, and passed me on the stairs, coming now forwards from the inner part of the room, to which there is no entrance\u2014you remember, Miss Matty\u2014and just repeating, in his pretty broken English, the inquiry if I had any business there\u2014I don\u2019t mean that he put it quite so bluntly, but he seemed very determined that I should not pass the screen\u2014so, of course, I explained about my glove, which, curiously enough, I found at that very moment.\u201d\n\nMiss Pole, then, had seen the conjuror\u2014the real, live conjuror! and numerous were the questions we all asked her. \u201cHad he a beard?\u201d \u201cWas he young, or old?\u201d \u201cFair, or dark?\u201d \u201cDid he look\u201d\u2014(unable to shape my question prudently, I put it in another form)\u2014\u201cHow did he look?\u201d In short, Miss Pole was the heroine of the evening, owing to her morning\u2019s encounter. If she was not the rose (that is to say the conjuror) she had been near it.\n\nConjuration, sleight of hand, magic, witchcraft, were the subjects of the evening. Miss Pole was slightly sceptical, and inclined to think there might be a scientific solution found for even the proceedings of the Witch of Endor. Mrs Forrester believed everything, from ghosts to death-watches. Miss Matty ranged between the two\u2014always convinced by the last speaker. I think she was naturally more inclined to Mrs Forrester\u2019s side, but a desire of proving herself a worthy sister to Miss Jenkyns kept her equally balanced\u2014Miss Jenkyns, who would never allow a servant to call the little rolls of tallow that formed themselves round candles \u201cwinding-sheets,\u201d but insisted on their being spoken of as \u201croley-poleys!\u201d A sister of hers to be superstitious! It would never do.\n\nAfter tea, I was despatched downstairs into the dining-parlour for that volume of the old Encyclop\xe6dia which contained the nouns beginning with C, in order that Miss Pole might prime herself with scientific explanations for the tricks of the following evening. It spoilt the pool at Preference which Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester had been looking forward to, for Miss Pole became so much absorbed in her subject, and the plates by which it was illustrated, that we felt it would be cruel to disturb her otherwise than by one or two well-timed yawns, which I threw in now and then, for I was really touched by the meek way in which the two ladies were bearing their disappointment. But Miss Pole only read the more zealously, imparting to us no more information than this\u2014\n\n\u201cAh! I see; I comprehend perfectly. A represents the ball. Put A between B and D\u2014no! between C and F, and turn the second joint of the third finger of your left hand over the wrist of your right H. Very clear indeed! My dear Mrs Forrester, conjuring and witchcraft is a mere affair of the alphabet. Do let me read you this one passage?\u201d\n\nMrs Forrester implored Miss Pole to spare her, saying, from a child upwards, she never could understand being read aloud to; and I dropped the pack of cards, which I had been shuffling very audibly, and by this discreet movement I obliged Miss Pole to perceive that Preference was to have been the order of the evening, and to propose, rather unwillingly, that the pool should commence. The pleasant brightness that stole over the other two ladies\u2019 faces on this! Miss Matty had one or two twinges of self-reproach for having interrupted Miss Pole in her studies: and did not remember her cards well, or give her full attention to the game, until she had soothed her conscience by offering to lend the volume of the Encyclop\xe6dia to Miss Pole, who accepted it thankfully, and said Betty should take it home when she came with the lantern.\n\nThe next evening we were all in a little gentle flutter at the idea of the gaiety before us. Miss Matty went up to dress betimes, and hurried me until I was ready, when we found we had an hour-and-a-half to wait before the \u201cdoors opened at seven precisely.\u201d And we had only twenty yards to go! However, as Miss Matty said, it would not do to get too much absorbed in anything, and forget the time; so she thought we had better sit quietly, without lighting the candles, till five minutes to seven. So Miss Matty dozed, and I knitted.\n\nAt length we set off; and at the door under the carriage-way at the \u201cGeorge,\u201d we met Mrs Forrester and Miss Pole: the latter was discussing the subject of the evening with more vehemence than ever, and throwing X\u2019s and B\u2019s at our heads like hailstones. She had even copied one or two of the \u201creceipts\u201d\u2014as she called them\u2014for the different tricks, on backs of letters, ready to explain and to detect Signor Brunoni\u2019s arts.\n\nWe went into the cloak-room adjoining the Assembly Room; Miss Matty gave a sigh or two to her departed youth, and the remembrance of the last time she had been there, as she adjusted her pretty new cap before the strange, quaint old mirror in the cloak-room. The Assembly Room had been added to the inn, about a hundred years before, by the different county families, who met together there once a month during the winter to dance and play at cards. Many a county beauty had first swung through the minuet that she afterwards danced before Queen Charlotte in this very room. It was said that one of the Gunnings had graced the apartment with her beauty; it was certain that a rich and beautiful widow, Lady Williams, had here been smitten with the noble figure of a young artist, who was staying with some family in the neighbourhood for professional purposes, and accompanied his patrons to the Cranford Assembly. And a pretty bargain poor Lady Williams had of her handsome husband, if all tales were true. Now, no beauty blushed and dimpled along the sides of the Cranford Assembly Room; no handsome artist won hearts by his bow, chapeau bras in hand; the old room was dingy; the salmon-coloured paint had faded into a drab; great pieces of plaster had chipped off from the fine wreaths and festoons on its walls; but still a mouldy odour of aristocracy lingered about the place, and a dusty recollection of the days that were gone made Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester bridle up as they entered, and walk mincingly up the room, as if there were a number of genteel observers, instead of two little boys with a stick of toffee between them with which to beguile the time.\n\nWe stopped short at the second front row; I could hardly understand why, until I heard Miss Pole ask a stray waiter if any of the county families were expected; and when he shook his head, and believed not, Mrs Forrester and Miss Matty moved forwards, and our party represented a conversational square. The front row was soon augmented and enriched by Lady Glenmire and Mrs Jamieson. We six occupied the two front rows, and our aristocratic seclusion was respected by the groups of shopkeepers who strayed in from time to time and huddled together on the back benches. At least I conjectured so, from the noise they made, and the sonorous bumps they gave in sitting down; but when, in weariness of the obstinate green curtain that would not draw up, but would stare at me with two odd eyes, seen through holes, as in the old tapestry story, I would fain have looked round at the merry chattering people behind me, Miss Pole clutched my arm, and begged me not to turn, for \u201cit was not the thing.\u201d What \u201cthe thing\u201d was, I never could find out, but it must have been something eminently dull and tiresome. However, we all sat eyes right, square front, gazing at the tantalising curtain, and hardly speaking intelligibly, we were so afraid of being caught in the vulgarity of making any noise in a place of public amusement. Mrs Jamieson was the most fortunate, for she fell asleep.\n\nAt length the eyes disappeared\u2014the curtain quivered\u2014one side went up before the other, which stuck fast; it was dropped again, and, with a fresh effort, and a vigorous pull from some unseen hand, it flew up, revealing to our sight a magnificent gentleman in the Turkish costume, seated before a little table, gazing at us (I should have said with the same eyes that I had last seen through the hole in the curtain) with calm and condescending dignity, \u201clike a being of another sphere,\u201d as I heard a sentimental voice ejaculate behind me.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not Signor Brunoni!\u201d said Miss Pole decidedly; and so audibly that I am sure he heard, for he glanced down over his flowing beard at our party with an air of mute reproach. \u201cSignor Brunoni had no beard\u2014but perhaps he\u2019ll come soon.\u201d So she lulled herself into patience. Meanwhile, Miss Matty had reconnoitred through her eye-glass, wiped it, and looked again. Then she turned round, and said to me, in a kind, mild, sorrowful tone\u2014\n\n\u201cYou see, my dear, turbans are worn.\u201d\n\nBut we had no time for more conversation. The Grand Turk, as Miss Pole chose to call him, arose and announced himself as Signor Brunoni.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe him!\u201d exclaimed Miss Pole, in a defiant manner. He looked at her again, with the same dignified upbraiding in his countenance. \u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d she repeated more positively than ever. \u201cSignor Brunoni had not got that muffy sort of thing about his chin, but looked like a close-shaved Christian gentleman.\u201d\n\nMiss Pole\u2019s energetic speeches had the good effect of wakening up Mrs Jamieson, who opened her eyes wide, in sign of the deepest attention\u2014a proceeding which silenced Miss Pole and encouraged the Grand Turk to proceed, which he did in very broken English\u2014so broken that there was no cohesion between the parts of his sentences; a fact which he himself perceived at last, and so left off speaking and proceeded to action.\n\nNow we were astonished. How he did his tricks I could not imagine; no, not even when Miss Pole pulled out her pieces of paper and began reading aloud\u2014or at least in a very audible whisper\u2014the separate \u201creceipts\u201d for the most common of his tricks. If ever I saw a man frown and look enraged, I saw the Grand Turk frown at Miss Pole; but, as she said, what could be expected but unchristian looks from a Mussulman? If Miss Pole were sceptical, and more engrossed with her receipts and diagrams than with his tricks, Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester were mystified and perplexed to the highest degree. Mrs Jamieson kept taking her spectacles off and wiping them, as if she thought it was something defective in them which made the legerdemain; and Lady Glenmire, who had seen many curious sights in Edinburgh, was very much struck with the tricks, and would not at all agree with Miss Pole, who declared that anybody could do them with a little practice, and that she would, herself, undertake to do all he did, with two hours given to study the Encyclop\xe6dia and make her third finger flexible.\n\nAt last Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester became perfectly awestricken. They whispered together. I sat just behind them, so I could not help hearing what they were saying. Miss Matty asked Mrs Forrester \u201cif she thought it was quite right to have come to see such things? She could not help fearing they were lending encouragement to something that was not quite\u201d\u2014 A little shake of the head filled up the blank. Mrs Forrester replied, that the same thought had crossed her mind; she too was feeling very uncomfortable, it was so very strange. She was quite certain that it was her pocket-handkerchief which was in that loaf just now; and it had been in her own hand not five minutes before. She wondered who had furnished the bread? She was sure it could not be Dakin, because he was the churchwarden. Suddenly Miss Matty half-turned towards me\u2014\n\n\u201cWill you look, my dear\u2014you are a stranger in the town, and it won\u2019t give rise to unpleasant reports\u2014will you just look round and see if the rector is here? If he is, I think we may conclude that this wonderful man is sanctioned by the Church, and that will be a great relief to my mind.\u201d\n\nI looked, and I saw the tall, thin, dry, dusty rector, sitting surrounded by National School boys, guarded by troops of his own sex from any approach of the many Cranford spinsters. His kind face was all agape with broad smiles, and the boys around him were in chinks of laughing. I told Miss Matty that the Church was smiling approval, which set her mind at ease.\n\nAfraid of matrimonial reports\n\nI have never named Mr Hayter, the rector, because I, as a well-to-do and happy young woman, never came in contact with him. He was an old bachelor, but as afraid of matrimonial reports getting abroad about him as any girl of eighteen: and he would rush into a shop or dive down an entry, sooner than encounter any of the Cranford ladies in the street; and, as for the Preference parties, I did not wonder at his not accepting invitations to them. To tell the truth, I always suspected Miss Pole of having given very vigorous chase to Mr Hayter when he first came to Cranford; and not the less, because now she appeared to share so vividly in his dread lest her name should ever be coupled with his. He found all his interests among the poor and helpless; he had treated the National School boys this very night to the performance; and virtue was for once its own reward, for they guarded him right and left, and clung round him as if he had been the queen-bee and they the swarm. He felt so safe in their environment that he could even afford to give our party a bow as we filed out. Miss Pole ignored his presence, and pretended to be absorbed in convincing us that we had been cheated, and had not seen Signor Brunoni after all.\nCHAPTER X.\nTHE PANIC\n\nI think a series of circumstances dated from Signor Brunoni\u2019s visit to Cranford, which seemed at the time connected in our minds with him, though I don\u2019t know that he had anything really to do with them. All at once all sorts of uncomfortable rumours got afloat in the town. There were one or two robberies\u2014real bon\xe2 fide robberies; men had up before the magistrates and committed for trial\u2014and that seemed to make us all afraid of being robbed; and for a long time, at Miss Matty\u2019s, I know, we used to make a regular expedition all round the kitchens and cellars every night, Miss Matty leading the way, armed with the poker, I following with the hearth-brush, and Martha carrying the shovel and fire-irons with which to sound the alarm; and by the accidental hitting together of them she often frightened us so much that we bolted ourselves up, all three together, in the back-kitchen, or store-room, or wherever we happened to be, till, when our affright was over, we recollected ourselves and set out afresh with double valiance. By day we heard strange stories from the shopkeepers and cottagers, of carts that went about in the dead of night, drawn by horses shod with felt, and guarded by men in dark clothes, going round the town, no doubt in search of some unwatched house or some unfastened door.\n\nMiss Pole, who affected great bravery herself, was the principal person to collect and arrange these reports so as to make them assume their most fearful aspect. But we discovered that she had begged one of Mr Hoggins\u2019s worn-out hats to hang up in her lobby, and we (at least I) had doubts as to whether she really would enjoy the little adventure of having her house broken into, as she protested she should. Miss Matty made no secret of being an arrant coward, but she went regularly through her housekeeper\u2019s duty of inspection\u2014only the hour for this became earlier and earlier, till at last we went the rounds at half-past six, and Miss Matty adjourned to bed soon after seven, \u201cin order to get the night over the sooner.\u201d\n\nCranford had so long piqued itself on being an honest and moral town that it had grown to fancy itself too genteel and well-bred to be otherwise, and felt the stain upon its character at this time doubly. But we comforted ourselves with the assurance which we gave to each other that the robberies could never have been committed by any Cranford person; it must have been a stranger or strangers who brought this disgrace upon the town, and occasioned as many precautions as if we were living among the Red Indians or the French.\n\nThis last comparison of our nightly state of defence and fortification was made by Mrs Forrester, whose father had served under General Burgoyne in the American war, and whose husband had fought the French in Spain. She indeed inclined to the idea that, in some way, the French were connected with the small thefts, which were ascertained facts, and the burglaries and highway robberies, which were rumours. She had been deeply impressed with the idea of French spies at some time in her life; and the notion could never be fairly eradicated, but sprang up again from time to time. And now her theory was this:\u2014The Cranford people respected themselves too much, and were too grateful to the aristocracy who were so kind as to live near the town, ever to disgrace their bringing up by being dishonest or immoral; therefore, we must believe that the robbers were strangers\u2014if strangers, why not foreigners?\u2014if foreigners, who so likely as the French? Signor Brunoni spoke broken English like a Frenchman; and, though he wore a turban like a Turk, Mrs Forrester had seen a print of Madame de Sta\xebl with a turban on, and another of Mr Denon in just such a dress as that in which the conjuror had made his appearance, showing clearly that the French, as well as the Turks, wore turbans. There could be no doubt Signor Brunoni was a Frenchman\u2014a French spy come to discover the weak and undefended places of England, and doubtless he had his accomplices. For her part, she, Mrs Forrester, had always had her own opinion of Miss Pole\u2019s adventure at the \u201cGeorge Inn\u201d\u2014seeing two men where only one was believed to be. French people had ways and means which, she was thankful to say, the English knew nothing about; and she had never felt quite easy in her mind about going to see that conjuror\u2014it was rather too much like a forbidden thing, though the rector was there. In short, Mrs Forrester grew more excited than we had ever known her before, and, being an officer\u2019s daughter and widow, we looked up to her opinion, of course.\n\nReally I do not know how much was true or false in the reports which flew about like wildfire just at this time; but it seemed to me then that there was every reason to believe that at Mardon (a small town about eight miles from Cranford) houses and shops were entered by holes made in the walls, the bricks being silently carried away in the dead of the night, and all done so quietly that no sound was heard either in or out of the house. Miss Matty gave it up in despair when she heard of this. \u201cWhat was the use,\u201d said she, \u201cof locks and bolts, and bells to the windows, and going round the house every night? That last trick was fit for a conjuror. Now she did believe that Signor Brunoni was at the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nOne afternoon, about five o\u2019clock, we were startled by a hasty knock at the door. Miss Matty bade me run and tell Martha on no account to open the door till she (Miss Matty) had reconnoitred through the window; and she armed herself with a footstool to drop down on the head of the visitor, in case he should show a face covered with black crape, as he looked up in answer to her inquiry of who was there. But it was nobody but Miss Pole and Betty. The former came upstairs, carrying a little hand-basket, and she was evidently in a state of great agitation.\n\n\u201cTake care of that!\u201d said she to me, as I offered to relieve her of her basket. \u201cIt\u2019s my plate. I am sure there is a plan to rob my house to-night. I am come to throw myself on your hospitality, Miss Matty. Betty is going to sleep with her cousin at the \u2018George.\u2019 I can sit up here all night if you will allow me; but my house is so far from any neighbours, and I don\u2019t believe we could be heard if we screamed ever so!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Miss Matty, \u201cwhat has alarmed you so much? Have you seen any men lurking about the house?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d answered Miss Pole. \u201cTwo very bad-looking men have gone three times past the house, very slowly; and an Irish beggar-woman came not half-an-hour ago, and all but forced herself in past Betty, saying her children were starving, and she must speak to the mistress. You see, she said \u2018mistress,\u2019 though there was a hat hanging up in the hall, and it would have been more natural to have said \u2018master.\u2019 But Betty shut the door in her face, and came up to me, and we got the spoons together, and sat in the parlour-window watching till we saw Thomas Jones going from his work, when we called to him and asked him to take care of us into the town.\u201d\n\nWe might have triumphed over Miss Pole, who had professed such bravery until she was frightened; but we were too glad to perceive that she shared in the weaknesses of humanity to exult over her; and I gave up my room to her very willingly, and shared Miss Matty\u2019s bed for the night. But before we retired, the two ladies rummaged up, out of the recesses of their memory, such horrid stories of robbery and murder that I quite quaked in my shoes. Miss Pole was evidently anxious to prove that such terrible events had occurred within her experience that she was justified in her sudden panic; and Miss Matty did not like to be outdone, and capped every story with one yet more horrible, till it reminded me oddly enough, of an old story I had read somewhere, of a nightingale and a musician, who strove one against the other which could produce the most admirable music, till poor Philomel dropped down dead.\n\nOne of the stories that haunted me for a long time afterwards was of a girl who was left in charge of a great house in Cumberland on some particular fair-day, when the other servants all went off to the gaieties. The family were away in London, and a pedlar came by, and asked to leave his large and heavy pack in the kitchen, saying he would call for it again at night; and the girl (a gamekeeper\u2019s daughter), roaming about in search of amusement, chanced to hit upon a gun hanging up in the hall, and took it down to look at the chasing; and it went off through the open kitchen door, hit the pack, and a slow dark thread of blood came oozing out. (How Miss Pole enjoyed this part of the story, dwelling on each word as if she loved it!) She rather hurried over the further account of the girl\u2019s bravery, and I have but a confused idea that, somehow, she baffled the robbers with Italian irons, heated red-hot, and then restored to blackness by being dipped in grease.\n\nWe parted for the night with an awe-stricken wonder as to what we should hear of in the morning\u2014and, on my part, with a vehement desire for the night to be over and gone: I was so afraid lest the robbers should have seen, from some dark lurking-place, that Miss Pole had carried off her plate, and thus have a double motive for attacking our house.\n\nAsked him to take care of us\n\nBut until Lady Glenmire came to call next day we heard of nothing unusual. The kitchen fire-irons were in exactly the same position against the back door as when Martha and I had skilfully piled them up, like spillikins, ready to fall with an awful clatter if only a cat had touched the outside panels. I had wondered what we should all do if thus awakened and alarmed, and had proposed to Miss Matty that we should cover up our faces under the bed-clothes so that there should be no danger of the robbers thinking that we could identify them; but Miss Matty, who was trembling very much, scouted this idea, and said we owed it to society to apprehend them, and that she should certainly do her best to lay hold of them and lock them up in the garret till morning.\n\nWhen Lady Glenmire came, we almost felt jealous of her. Mrs Jamieson\u2019s house had really been attacked; at least there were men\u2019s footsteps to be seen on the flower borders, underneath the kitchen windows, \u201cwhere nae men should be;\u201d and Carlo had barked all through the night as if strangers were abroad. Mrs Jamieson had been awakened by Lady Glenmire, and they had rung the bell which communicated with Mr Mulliner\u2019s room in the third storey, and when his night-capped head had appeared over the bannisters, in answer to the summons, they had told him of their alarm, and the reasons for it; whereupon he retreated into his bedroom, and locked the door (for fear of draughts, as he informed them in the morning), and opened the window, and called out valiantly to say, if the supposed robbers would come to him he would fight them; but, as Lady Glenmire observed, that was but poor comfort, since they would have to pass by Mrs Jamieson\u2019s room and her own before they could reach him, and must be of a very pugnacious disposition indeed if they neglected the opportunities of robbery presented by the unguarded lower storeys, to go up to a garret, and there force a door in order to get at the champion of the house. Lady Glenmire, after waiting and listening for some time in the drawing-room, had proposed to Mrs Jamieson that they should go to bed; but that lady said she should not feel comfortable unless she sat up and watched; and, accordingly, she packed herself warmly up on the sofa, where she was found by the housemaid, when she came into the room at six o\u2019clock, fast asleep; but Lady Glenmire went to bed, and kept awake all night.\n\nWhen Miss Pole heard of this, she nodded her head in great satisfaction. She had been sure we should hear of something happening in Cranford that night; and we had heard. It was clear enough they had first proposed to attack her house; but when they saw that she and Betty were on their guard, and had carried off the plate, they had changed their tactics and gone to Mrs Jamieson\u2019s, and no one knew what might have happened if Carlo had not barked, like a good dog as he was!\n\nPoor Carlo! his barking days were nearly over. Whether the gang who infested the neighbourhood were afraid of him, or whether they were revengeful enough, for the way in which he had baffled them on the night in question, to poison him; or whether, as some among the more uneducated people thought, he died of apoplexy, brought on by too much feeding and too little exercise; at any rate, it is certain that, two days after this eventful night, Carlo was found dead, with his poor legs stretched out stiff in the attitude of running, as if by such unusual exertion he could escape the sure pursuer, Death.\n\nWe were all sorry for Carlo, the old familiar friend who had snapped at us for so many years; and the mysterious mode of his death made us very uncomfortable. Could Signor Brunoni be at the bottom of this? He had apparently killed a canary with only a word of command; his will seemed of deadly force; who knew but what he might yet be lingering in the neighbourhood willing all sorts of awful things!\n\nWe whispered these fancies among ourselves in the evenings; but in the mornings our courage came back with the daylight, and in a week\u2019s time we had got over the shock of Carlo\u2019s death; all but Mrs Jamieson. She, poor thing, felt it as she had felt no event since her husband\u2019s death; indeed, Miss Pole said, that as the Honourable Mr Jamieson drank a good deal, and occasioned her much uneasiness, it was possible that Carlo\u2019s death might be the greater affliction. But there was always a tinge of cynicism in Miss Pole\u2019s remarks. However, one thing was clear and certain\u2014it was necessary for Mrs Jamieson to have some change of scene; and Mr Mulliner was very impressive on this point, shaking his head whenever we inquired after his mistress, and speaking of her loss of appetite and bad nights very ominously; and with justice too, for if she had two characteristics in her natural state of health they were a facility of eating and sleeping. If she could neither eat nor sleep, she must be indeed out of spirits and out of health.\n\nLady Glenmire (who had evidently taken very kindly to Cranford) did not like the idea of Mrs Jamieson\u2019s going to Cheltenham, and more than once insinuated pretty plainly that it was Mr Mulliner\u2019s doing, who had been much alarmed on the occasion of the house being attacked, and since had said, more than once, that he felt it a very responsible charge to have to defend so many women. Be that as it might, Mrs Jamieson went to Cheltenham, escorted by Mr Mulliner; and Lady Glenmire remained in possession of the house, her ostensible office being to take care that the maid-servants did not pick up followers. She made a very pleasant-looking dragon; and, as soon as it was arranged for her stay in Cranford, she found out that Mrs Jamieson\u2019s visit to Cheltenham was just the best thing in the world. She had let her house in Edinburgh, and was for the time house-less, so the charge of her sister-in-law\u2019s comfortable abode was very convenient and acceptable.\n\nMiss Pole was very much inclined to instal herself as a heroine, because of the decided steps she had taken in flying from the two men and one woman, whom she entitled \u201cthat murderous gang.\u201d She described their appearance in glowing colours, and I noticed that every time she went over the story some fresh trait of villainy was added to their appearance. One was tall\u2014he grew to be gigantic in height before we had done with him; he of course had black hair\u2014and by-and-by it hung in elf-locks over his forehead and down his back. The other was short and broad\u2014and a hump sprouted out on his shoulder before we heard the last of him; he had red hair\u2014which deepened into carroty; and she was almost sure he had a cast in the eye\u2014a decided squint. As for the woman, her eyes glared, and she was masculine-looking\u2014a perfect virago; most probably a man dressed in woman\u2019s clothes; afterwards, we heard of a beard on her chin, and a manly voice and a stride.\n\nIf Miss Pole was delighted to recount the events of that afternoon to all inquirers, others were not so proud of their adventures in the robbery line. Mr Hoggins, the surgeon, had been attacked at his own door by two ruffians, who were concealed in the shadow of the porch, and so effectually silenced him that he was robbed in the interval between ringing his bell and the servant\u2019s answering it. Miss Pole was sure it would turn out that this robbery had been committed by \u201cher men,\u201d and went the very day she heard the report to have her teeth examined, and to question Mr Hoggins. She came to us afterwards; so we heard what she had heard, straight and direct from the source, while we were yet in the excitement and flutter of the agitation caused by the first intelligence; for the event had only occurred the night before.\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d said Miss Pole, sitting down with the decision of a person who has made up her mind as to the nature of life and the world (and such people never tread lightly, or seat themselves without a bump), \u201cwell, Miss Matty! men will be men. Every mother\u2019s son of them wishes to be considered Samson and Solomon rolled into one\u2014too strong ever to be beaten or discomfited\u2014too wise ever to be outwitted. If you will notice, they have always foreseen events, though they never tell one for one\u2019s warning before the events happen. My father was a man, and I know the sex pretty well.\u201d\n\nShe had talked herself out of breath, and we should have been very glad to fill up the necessary pause as chorus, but we did not exactly know what to say, or which man had suggested this diatribe against the sex; so we only joined in generally, with a grave shake of the head, and a soft murmur of \u201cThey are very incomprehensible, certainly!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, only think,\u201d said she. \u201cThere, I have undergone the risk of having one of my remaining teeth drawn (for one is terribly at the mercy of any surgeon-dentist; and I, for one, always speak them fair till I have got my mouth out of their clutches), and, after all, Mr Hoggins is too much of a man to own that he was robbed last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot robbed!\u201d exclaimed the chorus.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me!\u201d Miss Pole exclaimed, angry that we could be for a moment imposed upon. \u201cI believe he was robbed, just as Betty told me, and he is ashamed to own it; and, to be sure, it was very silly of him to be robbed just at his own door; I daresay he feels that such a thing won\u2019t raise him in the eyes of Cranford society, and is anxious to conceal it\u2014but he need not have tried to impose upon me, by saying I must have heard an exaggerated account of some petty theft of a neck of mutton, which, it seems, was stolen out of the safe in his yard last week; he had the impertinence to add, he believed that that was taken by the cat. I have no doubt, if I could get at the bottom of it, it was that Irishman dressed up in woman\u2019s clothes, who came spying about my house, with the story about the starving children.\u201d\n\nAfter we had duly condemned the want of candour which Mr Hoggins had evinced, and abused men in general, taking him for the representative and type, we got round to the subject about which we had been talking when Miss Pole came in; namely, how far, in the present disturbed state of the country, we could venture to accept an invitation which Miss Matty had just received from Mrs Forrester, to come as usual and keep the anniversary of her wedding-day by drinking tea with her at five o\u2019clock, and playing a quiet pool afterwards. Mrs Forrester had said that she asked us with some diffidence, because the roads were, she feared, very unsafe. But she suggested that perhaps one of us would not object to take the sedan, and that the others, by walking briskly, might keep up with the long trot of the chairmen, and so we might all arrive safely at Over Place, a suburb of the town. (No; that is too large an expression: a small cluster of houses separated from Cranford by about two hundred yards of a dark and lonely lane.) There was no doubt but that a similar note was awaiting Miss Pole at home; so her call was a very fortunate affair, as it enabled us to consult together. We would all much rather have declined this invitation; but we felt that it would not be quite kind to Mrs Forrester, who would otherwise be left to a solitary retrospect of her not very happy or fortunate life. Miss Matty and Miss Pole had been visitors on this occasion for many years, and now they gallantly determined to nail their colours to the mast, and to go through Darkness Lane rather than fail in loyalty to their friend.\n\nBut when the evening came, Miss Matty (for it was she who was voted into the chair, as she had a cold), before being shut down in the sedan, like jack-in-a-box, implored the chairmen, whatever might befall, not to run away and leave her fastened up there, to be murdered; and even after they had promised, I saw her tighten her features into the stern determination of a martyr, and she gave me a melancholy and ominous shake of the head through the glass. However, we got there safely, only rather out of breath, for it was who could trot hardest through Darkness Lane, and I am afraid poor Miss Matty was sadly jolted.\n\nMrs Forrester had made extra preparations, in acknowledgment of our exertion in coming to see her through such dangers. The usual forms of genteel ignorance as to what her servants might send up were all gone through; and harmony and Preference seemed likely to be the order of the evening, but for an interesting conversation that began I don\u2019t know how, but which had relation, of course, to the robbers who infested the neighbourhood of Cranford.\n\nHaving braved the dangers of Darkness Lane, and thus having a little stock of reputation for courage to fall back upon; and also, I daresay, desirous of proving ourselves superior to men (videlicet Mr Hoggins) in the article of candour, we began to relate our individual fears, and the private precautions we each of us took. I owned that my pet apprehension was eyes\u2014eyes looking at me, and watching me, glittering out from some dull, flat, wooden surface; and that if I dared to go up to my looking-glass when I was panic-stricken, I should certainly turn it round, with its back towards me, for fear of seeing eyes behind me looking out of the darkness. I saw Miss Matty nerving herself up for a confession; and at last out it came. She owned that, ever since she had been a girl, she had dreaded being caught by her last leg, just as she was getting into bed, by some one concealed under it. She said, when she was younger and more active, she used to take a flying leap from a distance, and so bring both her legs up safely into bed at once; but that this had always annoyed Deborah, who piqued herself upon getting into bed gracefully, and she had given it up in consequence. But now the old terror would often come over her, especially since Miss Pole\u2019s house had been attacked (we had got quite to believe in the fact of the attack having taken place), and yet it was very unpleasant to think of looking under a bed, and seeing a man concealed, with a great, fierce face staring out at you; so she had bethought herself of something\u2014perhaps I had noticed that she had told Martha to buy her a penny ball, such as children play with\u2014and now she rolled this ball under the bed every night: if it came out on the other side, well and good; if not she always took care to have her hand on the bell-rope, and meant to call out John and Harry, just as if she expected men-servants to answer her ring.\n\nWe all applauded this ingenious contrivance, and Miss Matty sank back into satisfied silence, with a look at Mrs Forrester as if to ask for her private weakness.\n\nMrs Forrester looked askance at Miss Pole, and tried to change the subject a little by telling us that she had borrowed a boy from one of the neighbouring cottages and promised his parents a hundredweight of coals at Christmas, and his supper every evening, for the loan of him at nights. She had instructed him in his possible duties when he first came; and, finding him sensible, she had given him the Major\u2019s sword (the Major was her late husband), and desired him to put it very carefully behind his pillow at night, turning the edge towards the head of the pillow. He was a sharp lad, she was sure; for, spying out the Major\u2019s cocked hat, he had said, if he might have that to wear, he was sure he could frighten two Englishmen, or four Frenchmen any day. But she had impressed upon him anew that he was to lose no time in putting on hats or anything else; but, if he heard any noise, he was to run at it with his drawn sword. On my suggesting that some accident might occur from such slaughterous and indiscriminate directions, and that he might rush on Jenny getting up to wash, and have spitted her before he had discovered that she was not a Frenchman, Mrs Forrester said she did not think that that was likely, for he was a very sound sleeper, and generally had to be well shaken or cold-pigged in a morning before they could rouse him. She sometimes thought such dead sleep must be owing to the hearty suppers the poor lad ate, for he was half-starved at home, and she told Jenny to see that he got a good meal at night.\n\nSlaughterous and indiscriminate directions\n\nStill this was no confession of Mrs Forrester\u2019s peculiar timidity, and we urged her to tell us what she thought would frighten her more than anything. She paused, and stirred the fire, and snuffed the candles, and then she said, in a sounding whisper\u2014\n\n\u201cGhosts!\u201d\n\nShe looked at Miss Pole, as much as to say, she had declared it, and would stand by it. Such a look was a challenge in itself. Miss Pole came down upon her with indigestion, spectral illusions, optical delusions, and a great deal out of Dr Ferrier and Dr Hibbert besides. Miss Matty had rather a leaning to ghosts, as I have mentioned before, and what little she did say was all on Mrs Forrester\u2019s side, who, emboldened by sympathy, protested that ghosts were a part of her religion; that surely she, the widow of a major in the army, knew what to be frightened at, and what not; in short, I never saw Mrs Forrester so warm either before or since, for she was a gentle, meek, enduring old lady in most things. Not all the elder-wine that ever was mulled could this night wash out the remembrance of this difference between Miss Pole and her hostess. Indeed, when the elder-wine was brought in, it gave rise to a new burst of discussion; for Jenny, the little maiden who staggered under the tray, had to give evidence of having seen a ghost with her own eyes, not so many nights ago, in Darkness Lane, the very lane we were to go through on our way home.\n\nIn spite of the uncomfortable feeling which this last consideration gave me, I could not help being amused at Jenny\u2019s position, which was exceedingly like that of a witness being examined and cross-examined by two counsel who are not at all scrupulous about asking leading questions. The conclusion I arrived at was, that Jenny had certainly seen something beyond what a fit of indigestion would have caused. A lady all in white, and without her head, was what she deposed and adhered to, supported by a consciousness of the secret sympathy of her mistress under the withering scorn with which Miss Pole regarded her. And not only she, but many others, had seen this headless lady, who sat by the roadside wringing her hands as in deep grief. Mrs Forrester looked at us from time to time with an air of conscious triumph; but then she had not to pass through Darkness Lane before she could bury herself beneath her own familiar bed-clothes.\n\nWe preserved a discreet silence as to the headless lady while we were putting on our things to go home, for there was no knowing how near the ghostly head and ears might be, or what spiritual connection they might be keeping up with the unhappy body in Darkness Lane; and, therefore, even Miss Pole felt that it was as well not to speak lightly on such subjects, for fear of vexing or insulting that woebegone trunk. At least, so I conjecture; for, instead of the busy clatter usual in the operation, we tied on our cloaks as sadly as mutes at a funeral. Miss Matty drew the curtains round the windows of the chair to shut out disagreeable sights, and the men (either because they were in spirits that their labours were so nearly ended, or because they were going down hill), set off at such a round and merry pace, that it was all Miss Pole and I could do to keep up with them. She had breath for nothing beyond an imploring \u201cDon\u2019t leave me!\u201d uttered as she clutched my arm so tightly that I could not have quitted her, ghost or no ghost. What a relief it was when the men, weary of their burden and their quick trot, stopped just where Headingley Causeway branches off from Darkness Lane! Miss Pole unloosed me and caught at one of the men\u2014\n\n\u201cCould not you\u2014could not you take Miss Matty round by Headingley Causeway?\u2014the pavement in Darkness Lane jolts so, and she is not very strong.\u201d\n\nA smothered voice was heard from the inside of the chair\u2014\n\n\u201cOh! pray go on! What is the matter? What is the matter? I will give you sixpence more to go on very fast; pray don\u2019t stop here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll give you a shilling,\u201d said Miss Pole, with tremulous dignity, \u201cif you\u2019ll go by Headingley Causeway.\u201d\n\nThe two men grunted acquiescence and took up the chair, and went along the causeway, which certainly answered Miss Pole\u2019s kind purpose of saving Miss Matty\u2019s bones; for it was covered with soft, thick mud, and even a fall there would have been easy till the getting-up came, when there might have been some difficulty in extrication.\nCHAPTER XI.\nSAMUEL BROWN\n\nThe next morning I met Lady Glenmire and Miss Pole setting out on a long walk to find some old woman who was famous in the neighbourhood for her skill in knitting woollen stockings. Miss Pole said to me, with a smile half-kindly and half-contemptuous upon her countenance, \u201cI have been just telling Lady Glenmire of our poor friend Mrs Forrester, and her terror of ghosts. It comes from living so much alone, and listening to the bug-a-boo stories of that Jenny of hers.\u201d She was so calm and so much above superstitious fears herself that I was almost ashamed to say how glad I had been of her Headingley Causeway proposition the night before, and turned off the conversation to something else.\n\nIn the afternoon Miss Pole called on Miss Matty to tell her of the adventure\u2014the real adventure they had met with on their morning\u2019s walk. They had been perplexed about the exact path which they were to take across the fields in order to find the knitting old woman, and had stopped to inquire at a little wayside public-house, standing on the high road to London, about three miles from Cranford. The good woman had asked them to sit down and rest themselves while she fetched her husband, who could direct them better than she could; and, while they were sitting in the sanded parlour, a little girl came in. They thought that she belonged to the landlady, and began some trifling conversation with her; but, on Mrs Roberts\u2019s return, she told them that the little thing was the only child of a couple who were staying in the house. And then she began a long story, out of which Lady Glenmire and Miss Pole could only gather one or two decided facts, which were that, about six weeks ago, a light spring-cart had broken down just before their door, in which there were two men, one woman, and this child. One of the men was seriously hurt\u2014no bones broken, only \u201cshaken,\u201d the landlady called it; but he had probably sustained some severe internal injury, for he had languished in their house ever since, attended by his wife, the mother of this little girl. Miss Pole had asked what he was, what he looked like. And Mrs Roberts had made answer that he was not like a gentleman, nor yet like a common person; if it had not been that he and his wife were such decent, quiet people, she could almost have thought he was a mountebank, or something of that kind, for they had a great box in the cart, full of she did not know what. She had helped to unpack it, and take out their linen and clothes, when the other man\u2014his twin-brother, she believed he was\u2014had gone off with the horse and cart.\n\nMiss Pole had begun to have her suspicions at this point, and expressed her idea that it was rather strange that the box and cart and horse and all should have disappeared; but good Mrs Roberts seemed to have become quite indignant at Miss Pole\u2019s implied suggestion; in fact, Miss Pole said she was as angry as if Miss Pole had told her that she herself was a swindler. As the best way of convincing the ladies, she bethought her of begging them to see the wife; and, as Miss Pole said, there was no doubting the honest, worn, bronzed face of the woman, who at the first tender word from Lady Glenmire, burst into tears, which she was too weak to check until some word from the landlady made her swallow down her sobs, in order that she might testify to the Christian kindness shown by Mr and Mrs Roberts. Miss Pole came round with a swing to as vehement a belief in the sorrowful tale as she had been sceptical before; and, as a proof of this, her energy in the poor sufferer\u2019s behalf was nothing daunted when she found out that he, and no other, was our Signor Brunoni, to whom all Cranford had been attributing all manner of evil this six weeks past! Yes! his wife said his proper name was Samuel Brown\u2014\u201cSam,\u201d she called him\u2014but to the last we preferred calling him \u201cthe Signor\u201d; it sounded so much better.\n\nThe end of their conversation with the Signora Brunoni was that it was agreed that he should be placed under medical advice, and for any expense incurred in procuring this Lady Glenmire promised to hold herself responsible, and had accordingly gone to Mr Hoggins to beg him to ride over to the \u201cRising Sun\u201d that very afternoon, and examine into the signor\u2019s real state; and, as Miss Pole said, if it was desirable to remove him to Cranford to be more immediately under Mr Hoggins\u2019s eye, she would undertake to see for lodgings and arrange about the rent. Mrs Roberts had been as kind as could be all throughout, but it was evident that their long residence there had been a slight inconvenience.\n\nBefore Miss Pole left us, Miss Matty and I were as full of the morning\u2019s adventure as she was. We talked about it all the evening, turning it in every possible light, and we went to bed anxious for the morning, when we should surely hear from someone what Mr Hoggins thought and recommended; for, as Miss Matty observed, though Mr Hoggins did say \u201cJack\u2019s up,\u201d \u201ca fig for his heels,\u201d and called Preference \u201cPref.\u201d she believed he was a very worthy man and a very clever surgeon. Indeed, we were rather proud of our doctor at Cranford, as a doctor. We often wished, when we heard of Queen Adelaide or the Duke of Wellington being ill, that they would send for Mr Hoggins; but, on consideration, we were rather glad they did not, for, if we were ailing, what should we do if Mr Hoggins had been appointed physician-in-ordinary to the Royal Family? As a surgeon we were proud of him; but as a man\u2014or rather, I should say, as a gentleman\u2014we could only shake our heads over his name and himself, and wished that he had read Lord Chesterfield\u2019s Letters in the days when his manners were susceptible of improvement. Nevertheless, we all regarded his dictum in the signor\u2019s case as infallible, and when he said that with care and attention he might rally, we had no more fear for him.\n\nBut, although we had no more fear, everybody did as much as if there was great cause for anxiety\u2014as indeed there was until Mr Hoggins took charge of him. Miss Pole looked out clean and comfortable, if homely, lodgings; Miss Matty sent the sedan-chair for him, and Martha and I aired it well before it left Cranford by holding a warming-pan full of red-hot coals in it, and then shutting it up close, smoke and all, until the time when he should get into it at the \u201cRising Sun.\u201d Lady Glenmire undertook the medical department under Mr Hoggins\u2019s directions, and rummaged up all Mrs Jamieson\u2019s medicine glasses, and spoons, and bed-tables, in a free-and-easy way, that made Miss Matty feel a little anxious as to what that lady and Mr Mulliner might say, if they knew. Mrs Forrester made some of the bread-jelly, for which she was so famous, to have ready as a refreshment in the lodgings when he should arrive. A present of this bread-jelly was the highest mark of favour dear Mrs Forrester could confer. Miss Pole had once asked her for the receipt, but she had met with a very decided rebuff; that lady told her that she could not part with it to any one during her life, and that after her death it was bequeathed, as her executors would find, to Miss Matty. What Miss Matty, or, as Mrs Forrester called her (remembering the clause in her will and the dignity of the occasion), Miss Matilda Jenkyns\u2014might choose to do with the receipt when it came into her possession\u2014whether to make it public, or to hand it down as an heirloom\u2014she did not know, nor would she dictate. And a mould of this admirable, digestible, unique bread-jelly was sent by Mrs Forrester to our poor sick conjuror. Who says that the aristocracy are proud? Here was a lady by birth a Tyrrell, and descended from the great Sir Walter that shot King Rufus, and in whose veins ran the blood of him who murdered the little princes in the Tower, going every day to see what dainty dishes she could prepare for Samuel Brown, a mountebank! But, indeed, it was wonderful to see what kind feelings were called out by this poor man\u2019s coming amongst us. And also wonderful to see how the great Cranford panic, which had been occasioned by his first coming in his Turkish dress, melted away into thin air on his second coming\u2014pale and feeble, and with his heavy, filmy eyes, that only brightened a very little when they fell upon the countenance of his faithful wife, or their pale and sorrowful little girl. "},{title:"Disqualified",author:"Charles L. Fontenay",gender:"Male",text:'Tardo and Peo were entertained royally at luncheon by Saranta, their host, who appeared to be the wealthy overlord of this portion of the planet. The meal was delicious\u2014tender, inch-thick steaks served with delicate wine sauce and half a dozen of the planet\'s exotic vegetables, topped off by a cool fruit dessert.\n\n"My recommendation will be of considerable importance to you," said Tardo as they ate. "If it is favorable, there is certain technical aid aboard ship which will be made available to you at once. Of course, you will not receive advanced equipment from the Solar Council until there is a more thorough investigation."\n\n"I\'m afraid our culture is too simple and agrarian to win your approval," said Saranta modestly.\n\n"That isn\'t a major consideration. The Council understands the difficulties that have faced colonies in other star systems. There are certain fundamental requirements, of course: no abnormal religious practices, no slavery ... well, you understand what I mean."\n\n"We really feel that we have done well since we ... our ancestors, that is ... colonized our world a thousand years ago," said Saranta, toying with a wineglass. A smiling servant filled the glasses of Tardo and Peo. "You see, there was no fuel for the ship to explore other planets in the system, and the ship just rusted away. Since we are some distance from the solar system, yours is the first ship that has landed here since colonization."\n\n"You seem to have been lucky, though," said Peo. He was navigator of the Council ship, and had asked to accompany Tardo on the brief inspection trip. "You could have landed on a barren planet."\n\n"Well, no, the colonizers knew it was liveable, from the first exploration expedition," said Saranta. "There were difficulties, of course. Luxuriant vegetation, but no animal life, so we had no animals to domesticate. Pulling a plow is hard work for a man."\n\n"But you were able to solve this situation in a humanitarian way?" asked Tardo, peering at him keenly. "That is to say, you didn\'t resort to slavery?"\n\nSaranta smiled and spread his hands slightly.\n\n"Does this look like a slave society to you?" he countered. "The colonists were anxious to co-operate to make the planet liveable. No one objected to work."\n\n"It\'s true we\'ve seen no slaves, that we know about," said Tardo. "But two days is a short time for inspection. I must draw most of my conclusions from the attitudes of you and the others who are our hosts. How about the servants here?"\n\n"They are paid," answered Saranta, and added ruefully: "There are those of us who think they are paid too well. They have a union, you know."\n\nTardo laughed.\n\n"A carry-over from Earth, no doubt," he commented. "An unusual one, too, for a culture without technology."\n\nWhen the meal was over, the two men from the ship were conducted on a tour of the area. It was a neat agricultural community, with broad fields, well-constructed buildings and, a short distance from Saranta\'s castle-like home, a village in which artisans and craftsmen plied their peaceful trades.\n\nPeo tried to notice what he thought Tardo would look for on such a short inspection. The Council agent, he knew, had had intensive training and many years of experience. It was hard for Peo to judge what factors Tardo would consider significant\u2014probably very minor ones that the average man would not notice, he thought.\n\nTardo had seemed most intent on the question of slavery, and Peo looked for signs of it. He could see none. The people of the planet had had time to conceal some things, of course. But the people they saw in the village wore a proud air of independence no slave could assume.\n\nSaranta apologized for their having to walk, explaining that there was no other means of transportation on the planet.\n\n"And, without transportation, you can understand why we have not been able to develop a technology," he added. "We hope transport will be included in the first assistance you will give us."\n\nTardo asked about the fields.\n\n"I see there is no one working them," he said. "Is that done by the villagers?"\n\n"Our labor supply is transient," answered Saranta after a moment\'s hesitation. "The laborers who will work our fields\u2014for a wage, of course\u2014are probably in the next town or the one beyond it now."\n\nAlpha Persei was sinking in the western sky when Tardo and Peo took their leave of Saranta and made their way down the road toward their planetary landing craft.\n\n"It looks like a good world to me," said Peo. "If tomorrow\'s inspection is as satisfactory, I suppose you will recommend the beginning of technical aid?"\n\n"There will be no inspection tour tomorrow, and I shall recommend against aid at this time," replied Tardo. "I\'ve seen enough."\n\n"Why?" asked Peo, surprised.\n\n"There are two classes of people on this planet, and we\'ve seen only one," said Tardo. "Those we have seen are freemen. The others are no better than animals. We give no aid that helps men tighten their hold over their fellows."\n\n"If you haven\'t seen them, how do you know there is another class?" demanded Peo. "There is no evidence of any such situation."\n\n"The evidence is well hidden. But if you think your stomach can take it now, I\'ll tell you. If you remember your history, colonizing ships 1000 years ago had no space to carry animals along. They had to depend on native animal life of the planet, and this planet had none."\n\n"Saranta said that. But I don\'t see ..."\n\n"Those were delicious steaks, weren\'t they?" remarked Tardo quietly.'},{title:"Don Quixote",author:"Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra",gender:"Male",text:" In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to saddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great sportsman. They will have it his surname was Quixada or Quesada (for here there is some difference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject), although from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was called Quexana. This, however, is of but little importance to our tale; it will be enough not to stray a hair\u2019s breadth from the truth in the telling of it.\n\nYou must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was at leisure (which was mostly all the year round) gave himself up to reading books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost entirely neglected the pursuit of his field-sports, and even the management of his property; and to such a pitch did his eagerness and infatuation go that he sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to read, and brought home as many of them as he could get. But of all there were none he liked so well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silva\u2019s composition, for their lucidity of style and complicated conceits were as pearls in his sight, particularly when in his reading he came upon courtships and cartels, where he often found passages like \u201cthe reason of the unreason with which my reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I murmur at your beauty;\u201d or again, \u201cthe high heavens, that of your divinity divinely fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desert your greatness deserves.\u201d Over conceits of this sort the poor gentleman lost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand them and worm the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not have made out or extracted had he come to life again for that special purpose. He was not at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianis gave and took, because it seemed to him that, great as were the surgeons who had cured him, he must have had his face and body covered all over with seams and scars. He commended, however, the author\u2019s way of ending his book with the promise of that interminable adventure, and many a time was he tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly as is there proposed, which no doubt he would have done, and made a successful piece of work of it too, had not greater and more absorbing thoughts prevented him.\n\nMany an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learned man, and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which had been the better knight, Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, the village barber, however, used to say that neither of them came up to the Knight of Ph\u0153bus, and that if there was any that could compare with him it was Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he had a spirit that was equal to every occasion, and was no finikin knight, nor lachrymose like his brother, while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind him. In short, he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn to dark, poring over them; and what with little sleep and much reading his brains got so dry that he lost his wits. His fancy grew full of what he used to read about in his books, enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, wooings, loves, agonies, and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so possessed his mind that the whole fabric of invention and fancy he read of was true, that to him no history in the world had more reality in it. He used to say the Cid Ruy Diaz was a very good knight, but that he was not to be compared with the Knight of the Burning Sword who with one back-stroke cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants. He thought more of Bernardo del Carpio because at Roncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of enchantments, availing himself of the artifice of Hercules when he strangled Ant\xe6us the son of Terra in his arms. He approved highly of the giant Morgante, because, although of the giant breed which is always arrogant and ill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But above all he admired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when he saw him sallying forth from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when beyond the seas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history says, was entirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of a Ganelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into the bargain.\n\nIn short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion that ever madman in this world hit upon, and that was that he fancied it was right and requisite, as well for the support of his own honour as for the service of his country, that he should make a knight-errant of himself, roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback in quest of adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he had read of as being the usual practices of knights-errant; righting every kind of wrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, in the issue, he was to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man saw himself crowned by the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond at least; and so, led away by the intense enjoyment he found in these pleasant fancies, he set himself forthwith to put his scheme into execution.\n\nThe first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to his great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying forgotten in a corner eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polished it as best he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that it had no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency, however, his ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet of pasteboard which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one. It is true that, in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he drew his sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of which undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do. The ease with which he had knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against that danger he set to work again, fixing bars of iron on the inside until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, not caring to try any more experiments with it, he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most perfect construction.\n\nHe next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a real and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that \u201ctantum pellis et ossa fuit,\u201d surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the Babieca of the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name to give him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse belonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own, should be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so as to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant, and what he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master taking a new character, he should take a new name, and that it should be a distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and calling he was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struck out, rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his memory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to his thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks in the world.\n\nHaving got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to get one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over this point, till at last he made up his mind to call himself \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d whence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious history have inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, and not Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting, however, that the valiant Amadis was not content to call himself curtly Amadis and nothing more, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it famous, and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight, resolved to add on the name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote of La Mancha, whereby, he considered, he described accurately his origin and country, and did honour to it in taking his surname from it.\n\nSo then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, his hack christened, and he himself confirmed, he came to the conclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love with; for a knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or fruit, or a body without a soul. As he said to himself, \u201cIf, for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common occurrence with knights-errant, and overthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to the waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue him, will it not be well to have someone I may send him to as a present, that he may come in and fall on his knees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say, \u2018I am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania, vanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently extolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to present myself before your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your pleasure\u2019?\u201d Oh, how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especially when he had thought of someone to call his Lady! There was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very good-looking farm-girl with whom he had been at one time in love, though, so far as is known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name was Aldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title of Lady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which should not be out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that of a princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del Toboso\u2014she being of El Toboso\u2014a name, to his mind, musical, uncommon, and significant, like all those he had already bestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him.\np007b.jpg (61K)\nCHAPTER II.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE FIRST SALLY THE INGENIOUS DON QUIXOTE MADE FROM HOME\np007c.jpg (97K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nThese preliminaries settled, he did not care to put off any longer the execution of his design, urged on to it by the thought of all the world was losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right, grievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, and duties to discharge. So, without giving notice of his intention to anyone, and without anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawning of the day (which was one of the hottest of the month of July) he donned his suit of armour, mounted Rocinante with his patched-up helmet on, braced his buckler, took his lance, and by the back door of the yard sallied forth upon the plain in the highest contentment and satisfaction at seeing with what ease he had made a beginning with his grand purpose. But scarcely did he find himself upon the open plain, when a terrible thought struck him, one all but enough to make him abandon the enterprise at the very outset. It occurred to him that he had not been dubbed a knight, and that according to the law of chivalry he neither could nor ought to bear arms against any knight; and that even if he had been, still he ought, as a novice knight, to wear white armour, without a device upon the shield until by his prowess he had earned one. These reflections made him waver in his purpose, but his craze being stronger than any reasoning, he made up his mind to have himself dubbed a knight by the first one he came across, following the example of others in the same case, as he had read in the books that brought him to this pass. As for white armour, he resolved, on the first opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than an ermine; and so comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that which his horse chose, for in this he believed lay the essence of adventures.\n\nThus setting out, our new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking to himself and saying, \u201cWho knows but that in time to come, when the veracious history of my famous deeds is made known, the sage who writes it, when he has to set forth my first sally in the early morning, will do it after this fashion? \u2018Scarce had the rubicund Apollo spread o\u2019er the face of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his bright hair, scarce had the little birds of painted plumage attuned their notes to hail with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of the rosy Dawn, that, deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse, was appearing to mortals at the gates and balconies of the Manchegan horizon, when the renowned knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, quitting the lazy down, mounted his celebrated steed Rocinante and began to traverse the ancient and famous Campo de Montiel;\u2019\u201d which in fact he was actually traversing. \u201cHappy the age, happy the time,\u201d he continued, \u201cin which shall be made known my deeds of fame, worthy to be moulded in brass, carved in marble, limned in pictures, for a memorial for ever. And thou, O sage magician, whoever thou art, to whom it shall fall to be the chronicler of this wondrous history, forget not, I entreat thee, my good Rocinante, the constant companion of my ways and wanderings.\u201d Presently he broke out again, as if he were love-stricken in earnest, \u201cO Princess Dulcinea, lady of this captive heart, a grievous wrong hast thou done me to drive me forth with scorn, and with inexorable obduracy banish me from the presence of thy beauty. O lady, deign to hold in remembrance this heart, thy vassal, that thus in anguish pines for love of thee.\u201d\n\nSo he went on stringing together these and other absurdities, all in the style of those his books had taught him, imitating their language as well as he could; and all the while he rode so slowly and the sun mounted so rapidly and with such fervour that it was enough to melt his brains if he had any. Nearly all day he travelled without anything remarkable happening to him, at which he was in despair, for he was anxious to encounter someone at once upon whom to try the might of his strong arm.\np008.jpg (289K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nWriters there are who say the first adventure he met with was that of Puerto Lapice; others say it was that of the windmills; but what I have ascertained on this point, and what I have found written in the annals of La Mancha, is that he was on the road all day, and towards nightfall his hack and he found themselves dead tired and hungry, when, looking all around to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd\u2019s shanty where he might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants, he perceived not far out of his road an inn, which was as welcome as a star guiding him to the portals, if not the palaces, of his redemption; and quickening his pace he reached it just as night was setting in. At the door were standing two young women, girls of the district as they call them, on their way to Seville with some carriers who had chanced to halt that night at the inn; and as, happen what might to our adventurer, everything he saw or imagined seemed to him to be and to happen after the fashion of what he read of, the moment he saw the inn he pictured it to himself as a castle with its four turrets and pinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting the drawbridge and moat and all the belongings usually ascribed to castles of the sort. To this inn, which to him seemed a castle, he advanced, and at a short distance from it he checked Rocinante, hoping that some dwarf would show himself upon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give notice that a knight was approaching the castle. But seeing that they were slow about it, and that Rocinante was in a hurry to reach the stable, he made for the inn door, and perceived the two gay damsels who were standing there, and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or lovely ladies taking their ease at the castle gate.\n\nAt this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through the stubbles collecting a drove of pigs (for, without any apology, that is what they are called) gave a blast of his horn to bring them together, and forthwith it seemed to Don Quixote to be what he was expecting, the signal of some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so with prodigious satisfaction he rode up to the inn and to the ladies, who, seeing a man of this sort approaching in full armour and with lance and buckler, were turning in dismay into the inn, when Don Quixote, guessing their fear by their flight, raising his pasteboard visor, disclosed his dry dusty visage, and with courteous bearing and gentle voice addressed them, \u201cYour ladyships need not fly or fear any rudeness, for that it belongs not to the order of knighthood which I profess to offer to anyone, much less to highborn maidens as your appearance proclaims you to be.\u201d The girls were looking at him and straining their eyes to make out the features which the clumsy visor obscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens, a thing so much out of their line, they could not restrain their laughter, which made Don Quixote wax indignant, and say, \u201cModesty becomes the fair, and moreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness; this, however, I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none other than to serve you.\u201d\n\nThe incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalier only increased the ladies\u2019 laughter, and that increased his irritation, and matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord had not come out, who, being a very fat man, was a very peaceful one. He, seeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more than his saddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or corselet, was not at all indisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement; but, in truth, standing in awe of such a complicated armament, he thought it best to speak him fairly, so he said, \u201cSe\xf1or Caballero, if your worship wants lodging, bating the bed (for there is not one in the inn) there is plenty of everything else here.\u201d Don Quixote, observing the respectful bearing of the Alcaide of the fortress (for so innkeeper and inn seemed in his eyes), made answer, \u201cSir Castellan, for me anything will suffice, for\n\n\u2018My armour is my only wear,\nMy only rest the fray.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe host fancied he called him Castellan because he took him for a \u201cworthy of Castile,\u201d though he was in fact an Andalusian, and one from the strand of San Lucar, as crafty a thief as Cacus and as full of tricks as a student or a page. \u201cIn that case,\u201d said he,\n\n\u201c\u2018Your bed is on the flinty rock,\nYour sleep to watch alway;\u2019\n\nand if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of sleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth, not to say for a single night.\u201d So saying, he advanced to hold the stirrup for Don Quixote, who got down with great difficulty and exertion (for he had not broken his fast all day), and then charged the host to take great care of his horse, as he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread in this world. The landlord eyed him over but did not find him as good as Don Quixote said, nor even half as good; and putting him up in the stable, he returned to see what might be wanted by his guest, whom the damsels, who had by this time made their peace with him, were now relieving of his armour. They had taken off his breastplate and backpiece, but they neither knew nor saw how to open his gorget or remove his make-shift helmet, for he had fastened it with green ribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots, required to be cut. This, however, he would not by any means consent to, so he remained all the evening with his helmet on, the drollest and oddest figure that can be imagined; and while they were removing his armour, taking the baggages who were about it for ladies of high degree belonging to the castle, he said to them with great sprightliness:\n\n\u201cOh, never, surely, was there knight\nSo served by hand of dame,\nAs served was he, Don Quixote hight,\nWhen from his town he came;\nWith maidens waiting on himself,\nPrincesses on his hack\u2014\n\n\u2014or Rocinante, for that, ladies mine, is my horse\u2019s name, and Don Quixote of La Mancha is my own; for though I had no intention of declaring myself until my achievements in your service and honour had made me known, the necessity of adapting that old ballad of Lancelot to the present occasion has given you the knowledge of my name altogether prematurely. A time, however, will come for your ladyships to command and me to obey, and then the might of my arm will show my desire to serve you.\u201d\n\nThe girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, had nothing to say in reply; they only asked him if he wanted anything to eat. \u201cI would gladly eat a bit of something,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor I feel it would come very seasonably.\u201d The day happened to be a Friday, and in the whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish they call in Castile \u201cabadejo,\u201d in Andalusia \u201cbacallao,\u201d and in some places \u201ccuradillo,\u201d and in others \u201ctroutlet;\u201d so they asked him if he thought he could eat troutlet, for there was no other fish to give him. \u201cIf there be troutlets enough,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cthey will be the same thing as a trout; for it is all one to me whether I am given eight reals in small change or a piece of eight; moreover, it may be that these troutlets are like veal, which is better than beef, or kid, which is better than goat. But whatever it be let it come quickly, for the burden and pressure of arms cannot be borne without support to the inside.\u201d They laid a table for him at the door of the inn for the sake of the air, and the host brought him a portion of ill-soaked and worse cooked stockfish, and a piece of bread as black and mouldy as his own armour; but a laughable sight it was to see him eating, for having his helmet on and the beaver up, he could not with his own hands put anything into his mouth unless someone else placed it there, and this service one of the ladies rendered him. But to give him anything to drink was impossible, or would have been so had not the landlord bored a reed, and putting one end in his mouth poured the wine into him through the other; all which he bore with patience rather than sever the ribbons of his helmet.\n\nWhile this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, as he approached, sounded his reed pipe four or five times, and thereby completely convinced Don Quixote that he was in some famous castle, and that they were regaling him with music, and that the stockfish was trout, the bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and the landlord the castellan of the castle; and consequently he held that his enterprise and sally had been to some purpose. But still it distressed him to think he had not been dubbed a knight, for it was plain to him he could not lawfully engage in any adventure without receiving the order of knighthood.\n\n\n\n\n\ne02.jpg (39K)\nCHAPTER III.\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE DROLL WAY IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE HAD HIMSELF DUBBED A KNIGHT\np009.jpg (164K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nHarassed by this reflection, he made haste with his scanty pothouse supper, and having finished it called the landlord, and shutting himself into the stable with him, fell on his knees before him, saying, \u201cFrom this spot I rise not, valiant knight, until your courtesy grants me the boon I seek, one that will redound to your praise and the benefit of the human race.\u201d The landlord, seeing his guest at his feet and hearing a speech of this kind, stood staring at him in bewilderment, not knowing what to do or say, and entreating him to rise, but all to no purpose until he had agreed to grant the boon demanded of him. \u201cI looked for no less, my lord, from your High Magnificence,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cand I have to tell you that the boon I have asked and your liberality has granted is that you shall dub me knight to-morrow morning, and that to-night I shall watch my arms in the chapel of this your castle; thus to-morrow, as I have said, will be accomplished what I so much desire, enabling me lawfully to roam through all the four quarters of the world seeking adventures on behalf of those in distress, as is the duty of chivalry and of knights-errant like myself, whose ambition is directed to such deeds.\u201d\n\nThe landlord, who, as has been mentioned, was something of a wag, and had already some suspicion of his guest\u2019s want of wits, was quite convinced of it on hearing talk of this kind from him, and to make sport for the night he determined to fall in with his humour. So he told him he was quite right in pursuing the object he had in view, and that such a motive was natural and becoming in cavaliers as distinguished as he seemed and his gallant bearing showed him to be; and that he himself in his younger days had followed the same honourable calling, roaming in quest of adventures in various parts of the world, among others the Curing-grounds of Malaga, the Isles of Riaran, the Precinct of Seville, the Little Market of Segovia, the Olivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of Granada, the Strand of San Lucar, the Colt of Cordova, the Taverns of Toledo, and divers other quarters, where he had proved the nimbleness of his feet and the lightness of his fingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows, ruining maids and swindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under the notice of almost every tribunal and court of justice in Spain; until at last he had retired to this castle of his, where he was living upon his property and upon that of others; and where he received all knights-errant of whatever rank or condition they might be, all for the great love he bore them and that they might share their substance with him in return for his benevolence. He told him, moreover, that in this castle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch his armour, as it had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt, but that in a case of necessity it might, he knew, be watched anywhere, and he might watch it that night in a courtyard of the castle, and in the morning, God willing, the requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to have him dubbed a knight, and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so. He asked if he had any money with him, to which Don Quixote replied that he had not a farthing, as in the histories of knights-errant he had never read of any of them carrying any. On this point the landlord told him he was mistaken; for, though not recorded in the histories, because in the author\u2019s opinion there was no need to mention anything so obvious and necessary as money and clean shirts, it was not to be supposed therefore that they did not carry them, and he might regard it as certain and established that all knights-errant (about whom there were so many full and unimpeachable books) carried well-furnished purses in case of emergency, and likewise carried shirts and a little box of ointment to cure the wounds they received. For in those plains and deserts where they engaged in combat and came out wounded, it was not always that there was someone to cure them, unless indeed they had for a friend some sage magician to succour them at once by fetching through the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of water of such virtue that by tasting one drop of it they were cured of their hurts and wounds in an instant and left as sound as if they had not received any damage whatever. But in case this should not occur, the knights of old took care to see that their squires were provided with money and other requisites, such as lint and ointments for healing purposes; and when it happened that knights had no squires (which was rarely and seldom the case) they themselves carried everything in cunning saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse\u2019s croup, as if it were something else of more importance, because, unless for some such reason, carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably regarded among knights-errant. He therefore advised him (and, as his godson so soon to be, he might even command him) never from that time forth to travel without money and the usual requirements, and he would find the advantage of them when he least expected it.\n\nDon Quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, and it was arranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard at one side of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placed it on a trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing his buckler on his arm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to march up and down in front of the trough, and as he began his march night began to fall.\n\nThe landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze of his guest, the watching of the armour, and the dubbing ceremony he contemplated. Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, they flocked to see it from a distance, and observed with what composure he sometimes paced up and down, or sometimes, leaning on his lance, gazed on his armour without taking his eyes off it for ever so long; and as the night closed in with a light from the moon so brilliant that it might vie with his that lent it, everything the novice knight did was plainly seen by all.\n\nMeanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water his team, and it was necessary to remove Don Quixote\u2019s armour as it lay on the trough; but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a loud voice, \u201cO thou, whoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay hands on the armour of the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword, have a care what thou dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thy life as the penalty of thy rashness.\u201d The carrier gave no heed to these words (and he would have done better to heed them if he had been heedful of his health), but seizing it by the straps flung the armour some distance from him. Seeing this, Don Quixote raised his eyes to heaven, and fixing his thoughts, apparently, upon his lady Dulcinea, exclaimed, \u201cAid me, lady mine, in this the first encounter that presents itself to this breast which thou holdest in subjection; let not thy favour and protection fail me in this first jeopardy;\u201d and, with these words and others to the same purpose, dropping his buckler he lifted his lance with both hands and with it smote such a blow on the carrier\u2019s head that he stretched him on the ground, so stunned that had he followed it up with a second there would have been no need of a surgeon to cure him. This done, he picked up his armour and returned to his beat with the same serenity as before.\np010.jpg (261K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nShortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened (for the carrier still lay senseless), came with the same object of giving water to his mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clear the trough, when Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aid from anyone, once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted his lance, and without actually breaking the second carrier\u2019s head into pieces, made more than three of it, for he laid it open in four. At the noise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and among them the landlord. Seeing this, Don Quixote braced his buckler on his arm, and with his hand on his sword exclaimed, \u201cO Lady of Beauty, strength and support of my faint heart, it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thy greatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an adventure.\u201d By this he felt himself so inspired that he would not have flinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him. The comrades of the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a distance to shower stones on Don Quixote, who screened himself as best he could with his buckler, not daring to quit the trough and leave his armour unprotected. The landlord shouted to them to leave him alone, for he had already told them that he was mad, and as a madman he would not be accountable even if he killed them all. Still louder shouted Don Quixote, calling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle, who allowed knights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a villain and a low-born knight whom, had he received the order of knighthood, he would call to account for his treachery. \u201cBut of you,\u201d he cried, \u201cbase and vile rabble, I make no account; fling, strike, come on, do all ye can against me, ye shall see what the reward of your folly and insolence will be.\u201d This he uttered with so much spirit and boldness that he filled his assailants with a terrible fear, and as much for this reason as at the persuasion of the landlord they left off stoning him, and he allowed them to carry off the wounded, and with the same calmness and composure as before resumed the watch over his armour.\n\nBut these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of the landlord, so he determined to cut matters short and confer upon him at once the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure could occur; so, going up to him, he apologised for the rudeness which, without his knowledge, had been offered to him by these low people, who, however, had been well punished for their audacity. As he had already told him, he said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor was it needed for what remained to be done, for, as he understood the ceremonial of the order, the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay in the accolade and in the slap on the shoulder, and that could be administered in the middle of a field; and that he had now done all that was needful as to watching the armour, for all requirements were satisfied by a watch of two hours only, while he had been more than four about it. Don Quixote believed it all, and told him he stood there ready to obey him, and to make an end of it with as much despatch as possible; for, if he were again attacked, and felt himself to be dubbed knight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul alive in the castle, except such as out of respect he might spare at his bidding.\n\nThus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in which he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the carriers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels already mentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him kneel down. Then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeating some devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand and gave him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, a smart slap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth as if he was saying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one of the ladies to gird on his sword, which she did with great self-possession and gravity, and not a little was required to prevent a burst of laughter at each stage of the ceremony; but what they had already seen of the novice knight\u2019s prowess kept their laughter within bounds. On girding him with the sword the worthy lady said to him, \u201cMay God make your worship a very fortunate knight, and grant you success in battle.\u201d Don Quixote asked her name in order that he might from that time forward know to whom he was beholden for the favour he had received, as he meant to confer upon her some portion of the honour he acquired by the might of his arm. She answered with great humility that she was called La Tolosa, and that she was the daughter of a cobbler of Toledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya, and that wherever she might be she would serve and esteem him as her lord. Don Quixote said in reply that she would do him a favour if thenceforward she assumed the \u201cDon\u201d and called herself Do\xf1a Tolosa. She promised she would, and then the other buckled on his spur, and with her followed almost the same conversation as with the lady of the sword. He asked her name, and she said it was La Molinera, and that she was the daughter of a respectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don Quixote requested that she would adopt the \u201cDon\u201d and call herself Do\xf1a Molinera, making offers to her further services and favours.\n\nHaving thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these never-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he saw himself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and saddling Rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he returned thanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in language so extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report it. The landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no less rhetoric though with shorter words, and without calling upon him to pay the reckoning let him go with a Godspeed.\np017.jpg (54K)\n\nFull Size\nCHAPTER IV.\nOF WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR KNIGHT WHEN HE LEFT THE INN\np018.jpg (94K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nDay was dawning when Don Quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, so exhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight, that his joy was like to burst his horse-girths. However, recalling the advice of his host as to the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that referring to money and shirts, he determined to go home and provide himself with all, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing a farm-labourer, a neighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but very well qualified for the office of squire to a knight. With this object he turned his horse\u2019s head towards his village, and Rocinante, thus reminded of his old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardly seemed to tread the earth.\n\nHe had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to come feeble cries as of someone in distress, and the instant he heard them he exclaimed, \u201cThanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me, that it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation I have undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition. These cries, no doubt, come from some man or woman in want of help, and needing my aid and protection;\u201d and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the direction whence the cries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces into the wood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and stripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age, from whom the cries came. Nor were they without cause, for a lusty farmer was flogging him with a belt and following up every blow with scoldings and commands, repeating, \u201cYour mouth shut and your eyes open!\u201d while the youth made answer, \u201cI won\u2019t do it again, master mine; by God\u2019s passion I won\u2019t do it again, and I\u2019ll take more care of the flock another time.\u201d\n\nSeeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice, \u201cDiscourteous knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot defend himself; mount your steed and take your lance\u201d (for there was a lance leaning against the oak to which the mare was tied), \u201cand I will make you know that you are behaving as a coward.\u201d The farmer, seeing before him this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his head, gave himself up for dead, and made answer meekly, \u201cSir Knight, this youth that I am chastising is my servant, employed by me to watch a flock of sheep that I have hard by, and he is so careless that I lose one every day, and when I punish him for his carelessness and knavery he says I do it out of niggardliness, to escape paying him the wages I owe him, and before God, and on my soul, he lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cLies before me, base clown!\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cBy the sun that shines on us I have a mind to run you through with this lance. Pay him at once without another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make an end of you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly.\u201d\np019.jpg (339K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nThe farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, of whom Don Quixote asked how much his master owed him.\n\nHe replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added it up, found that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to pay it down immediately, if he did not want to die for it.\n\nThe trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had sworn (though he had not sworn any) it was not so much; for there were to be taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him, and a real for two blood-lettings when he was sick.\n\n\u201cAll that is very well,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut let the shoes and the blood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him without any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid for, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood from him when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so on that score he owes you nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; let Andres come home with me, and I will pay him all, real by real.\u201d\n\n\u201cI go with him!\u201d said the youth. \u201cNay, God forbid! No, se\xf1or, not for the world; for once alone with me, he would flay me like a Saint Bartholomew.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will do nothing of the kind,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cI have only to command, and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order of knighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee the payment.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsider what you are saying, se\xf1or,\u201d said the youth; \u201cthis master of mine is not a knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; for he is Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat matters little,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cthere may be Haldudos knights; moreover, everyone is the son of his works.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d said Andres; \u201cbut this master of mine\u2014of what works is he the son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not refuse, brother Andres,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cbe good enough to come along with me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood there are in the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and perfumed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the perfumery I excuse you,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cgive it to him in reals, and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn; if not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and punish you; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard. And if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you, that you be more firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so, God be with you, and keep in mind what you have promised and sworn under those penalties that have been already declared to you.\u201d\n\nSo saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. The farmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared the wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and said, \u201cCome here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that undoer of wrongs has commanded me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy oath on it,\u201d said Andres, \u201cyour worship will be well advised to obey the command of that good knight\u2014may he live a thousand years\u2014for, as he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, he will come back and do as he said.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy oath on it, too,\u201d said the farmer; \u201cbut as I have a strong affection for you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment;\u201d and seizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave him such a flogging that he left him for dead.\n\n\u201cNow, Master Andres,\u201d said the farmer, \u201ccall on the undoer of wrongs; you will find he won\u2019t undo that, though I am not sure that I have quite done with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.\u201d But at last he untied him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in order to put the sentence pronounced into execution.\n\nAndres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look for the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him exactly what had happened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for all that, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing.\n\nThus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughly satisfied with what had taken place, as he considered he had made a very happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the road towards his village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice, \u201cWell mayest thou this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth, O Dulcinea del Toboso, fairest of the fair! since it has fallen to thy lot to hold subject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure a knight so renowned as is and will be Don Quixote of La Mancha, who, as all the world knows, yesterday received the order of knighthood, and hath to-day righted the greatest wrong and grievance that ever injustice conceived and cruelty perpetrated: who hath to-day plucked the rod from the hand of yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing that tender child.\u201d\n\nHe now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he was reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop to consider which road they should take. In imitation of them he halted for a while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinante his head, submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed out his first intention, which was to make straight for his own stable. After he had gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large party of people, who, as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, on their way to buy silk at Murcia. There were six of them coming along under their sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot. Scarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him that this must be some new adventure; and to help him to imitate as far as he could those passages he had read of in his books, here seemed to come one made on purpose, which he resolved to attempt. So with a lofty bearing and determination he fixed himself firmly in his stirrups, got his lance ready, brought his buckler before his breast, and planting himself in the middle of the road, stood waiting the approach of these knights-errant, for such he now considered and held them to be; and when they had come near enough to see and hear, he exclaimed with a haughty gesture, \u201cAll the world stand, unless all the world confess that in all the world there is no maiden fairer than the Empress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.\u201d\n\nThe traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of the strange figure that uttered it, and from both figure and language at once guessed the craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learn quietly what was the object of this confession that was demanded of them, and one of them, who was rather fond of a joke and was very sharp-witted, said to him, \u201cSir Knight, we do not know who this good lady is that you speak of; show her to us, for, if she be of such beauty as you suggest, with all our hearts and without any pressure we will confess the truth that is on your part required of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were to show her to you,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cwhat merit would you have in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point is that without seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend it; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant rabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order of knighthood requires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of your breed, here do I bide and await you relying on the justice of the cause I maintain.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir Knight,\u201d replied the trader, \u201cI entreat your worship in the name of this present company of princes, that, to save us from charging our consciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard of, and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses and Queens of the Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship will be pleased to show us some portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grain of wheat; for by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we shall be satisfied and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay, I believe we are already so far agreed with you that even though her portrait should show her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and sulphur from the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship, say all in her favour that you desire.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble,\u201d said Don Quixote, burning with rage, \u201cnothing of the kind, I say, only ambergris and civet in cotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than a Guadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered against beauty like that of my lady.\u201d\n\nAnd so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who had spoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrived that Rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gone hard with the rash trader. Down went Rocinante, and over went his master, rolling along the ground for some distance; and when he tried to rise he was unable, so encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs, helmet, and the weight of his old armour; and all the while he was struggling to get up he kept saying, \u201cFly not, cowards and caitiffs! stay, for not by my fault, but my horse\u2019s, am I stretched here.\u201d\np020.jpg (352K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nOne of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have had much good nature in him, hearing the poor prostrate man blustering in this style, was unable to refrain from giving him an answer on his ribs; and coming up to him he seized his lance, and having broken it in pieces, with one of them he began so to belabour our Don Quixote that, notwithstanding and in spite of his armour, he milled him like a measure of wheat. His masters called out not to lay on so hard and to leave him alone, but the muleteer\u2019s blood was up, and he did not care to drop the game until he had vented the rest of his wrath, and gathering up the remaining fragments of the lance he finished with a discharge upon the unhappy victim, who all through the storm of sticks that rained on him never ceased threatening heaven, and earth, and the brigands, for such they seemed to him. At last the muleteer was tired, and the traders continued their journey, taking with them matter for talk about the poor fellow who had been cudgelled. He when he found himself alone made another effort to rise; but if he was unable when whole and sound, how was he to rise after having been thrashed and well-nigh knocked to pieces? And yet he esteemed himself fortunate, as it seemed to him that this was a regular knight-errant\u2019s mishap, and entirely, he considered, the fault of his horse. However, battered in body as he was, to rise was beyond his power.\ne04.jpg (28K)\nCHAPTER V.\nIN WHICH THE NARRATIVE OF OUR KNIGHT\u2019S MISHAP IS CONTINUED\np022.jpg (123K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nFinding, then, that, in fact he could not move, he thought himself of having recourse to his usual remedy, which was to think of some passage in his books, and his craze brought to his mind that about Baldwin and the Marquis of Mantua, when Carloto left him wounded on the mountainside, a story known by heart by the children, not forgotten by the young men, and lauded and even believed by the old folk; and for all that not a whit truer than the miracles of Mahomet. This seemed to him to fit exactly the case in which he found himself, so, making a show of severe suffering, he began to roll on the ground and with feeble breath repeat the very words which the wounded knight of the wood is said to have uttered:\n\nWhere art thou, lady mine, that thou\nMy sorrow dost not rue?\nThou canst not know it, lady mine,\nOr else thou art untrue.\n\nAnd so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines:\n\nO noble Marquis of Mantua,\nMy Uncle and liege lord!\np026.jpg (316K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nAs chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened to come by a peasant from his own village, a neighbour of his, who had been with a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretched there, came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter with him that he complained so dolefully.\n\nDon Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua, his uncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, in which he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the Emperor\u2019s son and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.\n\nThe peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him of the visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he wiped his face, which was covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so he recognised him and said, \u201cSe\xf1or Quixada\u201d (for so he appears to have been called when he was in his senses and had not yet changed from a quiet country gentleman into a knight-errant), \u201cwho has brought your worship to this pass?\u201d But to all questions the other only went on with his ballad.\n\nSeeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate and backpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive no blood nor any mark whatever. He then contrived to raise him from the ground, and with no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, which seemed to him to be the easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms, even to the splinters of the lance, he tied them on Rocinante, and leading him by the bridle and the ass by the halter he took the road for the village, very sad to hear what absurd stuff Don Quixote was talking.\np029.jpg (285K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nNor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he could not sit upright on the ass, and from time to time he sent up sighs to heaven, so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him. And it could have been only the devil himself that put into his head tales to match his own adventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, he bethought himself of the Moor Abindarraez, when the Alcaide of Antequera, Rodrigo de Narvaez, took him prisoner and carried him away to his castle; so that when the peasant again asked him how he was and what ailed him, he gave him for reply the same words and phrases that the captive Abindarraez gave to Rodrigo de Narvaez, just as he had read the story in the \u201cDiana\u201d of Jorge de Montemayor where it is written, applying it to his own case so aptly that the peasant went along cursing his fate that he had to listen to such a lot of nonsense; from which, however, he came to the conclusion that his neighbour was mad, and so made all haste to reach the village to escape the wearisomeness of this harangue of Don Quixote\u2019s; who, at the end of it, said, \u201cSe\xf1or Don Rodrigo de Narvaez, your worship must know that this fair Xarifa I have mentioned is now the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, for whom I have done, am doing, and will do the most famous deeds of chivalry that in this world have been seen, are to be seen, or ever shall be seen.\u201d\n\nTo this the peasant answered, \u201cSe\xf1or\u2014sinner that I am!\u2014cannot your worship see that I am not Don Rodrigo de Narvaez nor the Marquis of Mantua, but Pedro Alonso your neighbour, and that your worship is neither Baldwin nor Abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman Se\xf1or Quixada?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know who I am,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cand I know that I may be not only those I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and even all the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have done all together and each of them on his own account.\u201d\n\nWith this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just as night was beginning to fall, but the peasant waited until it was a little later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in such a miserable trim. When it was what seemed to him the proper time he entered the village and went to Don Quixote\u2019s house, which he found all in confusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, who were great friends of Don Quixote, and his housekeeper was saying to them in a loud voice, \u201cWhat does your worship think can have befallen my master, Se\xf1or Licentiate Pero Perez?\u201d for so the curate was called; \u201cit is three days now since anything has been seen of him, or the hack, or the buckler, lance, or armour. Miserable me! I am certain of it, and it is as true as that I was born to die, that these accursed books of chivalry he has, and has got into the way of reading so constantly, have upset his reason; for now I remember having often heard him saying to himself that he would turn knight-errant and go all over the world in quest of adventures. To the devil and Barabbas with such books, that have brought to ruin in this way the finest understanding there was in all La Mancha!\u201d\n\nThe niece said the same, and, more: \u201cYou must know, Master Nicholas\u201d\u2014for that was the name of the barber\u2014\u201cit was often my uncle\u2019s way to stay two days and nights together poring over these unholy books of misventures, after which he would fling the book away and snatch up his sword and fall to slashing the walls; and when he was tired out he would say he had killed four giants like four towers; and the sweat that flowed from him when he was weary he said was the blood of the wounds he had received in battle; and then he would drink a great jug of cold water and become calm and quiet, saying that this water was a most precious potion which the sage Esquife, a great magician and friend of his, had brought him. But I take all the blame upon myself for never having told your worships of my uncle\u2019s vagaries, that you might put a stop to them before things had come to this pass, and burn all these accursed books\u2014for he has a great number\u2014that richly deserve to be burned like heretics.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo say I too,\u201d said the curate, \u201cand by my faith to-morrow shall not pass without public judgment upon them, and may they be condemned to the flames lest they lead those that read to behave as my good friend seems to have behaved.\u201d\n\nAll this the peasant heard, and from it he understood at last what was the matter with his neighbour, so he began calling aloud, \u201cOpen, your worships, to Se\xf1or Baldwin and to Se\xf1or the Marquis of Mantua, who comes badly wounded, and to Se\xf1or Abindarraez, the Moor, whom the valiant Rodrigo de Narvaez, the Alcaide of Antequera, brings captive.\u201d\n\nAt these words they all hurried out, and when they recognised their friend, master, and uncle, who had not yet dismounted from the ass because he could not, they ran to embrace him.\n\n\u201cHold!\u201d said he, \u201cfor I am badly wounded through my horse\u2019s fault; carry me to bed, and if possible send for the wise Urganda to cure and see to my wounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee there! plague on it!\u201d cried the housekeeper at this: \u201cdid not my heart tell the truth as to which foot my master went lame of? To bed with your worship at once, and we will contrive to cure you here without fetching that Hurgada. A curse I say once more, and a hundred times more, on those books of chivalry that have brought your worship to such a pass.\u201d\n\nThey carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds could find none, but he said they were all bruises from having had a severe fall with his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants, the biggest and the boldest to be found on earth.\n\n\u201cSo, so!\u201d said the curate, \u201care there giants in the dance? By the sign of the Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day is over.\u201d\n\nThey put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to all was\u2014give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that was what he needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant at great length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and the nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all which made the licentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day, which was to summon his friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go with him to Don Quixote\u2019s house.\np031.jpg (31K)\nCHAPTER VI.\nOF THE DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBER MADE IN THE LIBRARY OF OUR INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN\nc06a.jpg (92K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nHe was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of the room where the books, the authors of all the mischief, were, and right willingly she gave them. They all went in, the housekeeper with them, and found more than a hundred volumes of big books very well bound, and some other small ones. The moment the housekeeper saw them she turned about and ran out of the room, and came back immediately with a saucer of holy water and a sprinkler, saying, \u201cHere, your worship, se\xf1or licentiate, sprinkle this room; don\u2019t leave any magician of the many there are in these books to bewitch us in revenge for our design of banishing them from the world.\u201d\n\nThe simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate laugh, and he directed the barber to give him the books one by one to see what they were about, as there might be some to be found among them that did not deserve the penalty of fire.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the niece, \u201cthere is no reason for showing mercy to any of them; they have every one of them done mischief; better fling them out of the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire to them; or else carry them into the yard, and there a bonfire can be made without the smoke giving any annoyance.\u201d The housekeeper said the same, so eager were they both for the slaughter of those innocents, but the curate would not agree to it without first reading at any rate the titles.\n\nThe first that Master Nicholas put into his hand was \u201cThe four books of Amadis of Gaul.\u201d \u201cThis seems a mysterious thing,\u201d said the curate, \u201cfor, as I have heard say, this was the first book of chivalry printed in Spain, and from this all the others derive their birth and origin; so it seems to me that we ought inexorably to condemn it to the flames as the founder of so vile a sect.\u201d\n\n\u201cNay, sir,\u201d said the barber, \u201cI too, have heard say that this is the best of all the books of this kind that have been written, and so, as something singular in its line, it ought to be pardoned.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said the curate; \u201cand for that reason let its life be spared for the present. Let us see that other which is next to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d said the barber, \u201cthe \u2018Sergas de Esplandian,\u2019 the lawful son of Amadis of Gaul.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen verily,\u201d said the curate, \u201cthe merit of the father must not be put down to the account of the son. Take it, mistress housekeeper; open the window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the pile for the bonfire we are to make.\u201d\n\nThe housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction, and the worthy \u201cEsplandian\u201d went flying into the yard to await with all patience the fire that was in store for him.\n\n\u201cProceed,\u201d said the curate.\n\n\u201cThis that comes next,\u201d said the barber, \u201cis \u2018Amadis of Greece,\u2019 and, indeed, I believe all those on this side are of the same Amadis lineage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen to the yard with the whole of them,\u201d said the curate; \u201cfor to have the burning of Queen Pintiquiniestra, and the shepherd Darinel and his eclogues, and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his author, I would burn with them the father who begot me if he were going about in the guise of a knight-errant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am of the same mind,\u201d said the barber.\n\n\u201cAnd so am I,\u201d added the niece.\n\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d said the housekeeper, \u201chere, into the yard with them!\u201d\n\nThey were handed to her, and as there were many of them, she spared herself the staircase, and flung them down out of the window.\n\n\u201cWho is that tub there?\u201d said the curate.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d said the barber, \u201cis \u2018Don Olivante de Laura.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe author of that book,\u201d said the curate, \u201cwas the same that wrote \u2018The Garden of Flowers,\u2019 and truly there is no deciding which of the two books is the more truthful, or, to put it better, the less lying; all I can say is, send this one into the yard for a swaggering fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis that follows is \u2018Florismarte of Hircania,\u2019\u201d said the barber.\n\n\u201cSe\xf1or Florismarte here?\u201d said the curate; \u201cthen by my faith he must take up his quarters in the yard, in spite of his marvellous birth and visionary adventures, for the stiffness and dryness of his style deserve nothing else; into the yard with him and the other, mistress housekeeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all my heart, se\xf1or,\u201d said she, and executed the order with great delight.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d said the barber, \u201cis \u2018The Knight Platir.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAn old book that,\u201d said the curate, \u201cbut I find no reason for clemency in it; send it after the others without appeal;\u201d which was done.\n\nAnother book was opened, and they saw it was entitled, \u201cThe Knight of the Cross.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the sake of the holy name this book has,\u201d said the curate, \u201cits ignorance might be excused; but then, they say, \u2018behind the cross there\u2019s the devil;\u2019 to the fire with it.\u201d\n\nTaking down another book, the barber said, \u201cThis is \u2018The Mirror of Chivalry.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI know his worship,\u201d said the curate; \u201cthat is where Se\xf1or Reinaldos of Montalvan figures with his friends and comrades, greater thieves than Cacus, and the Twelve Peers of France with the veracious historian Turpin; however, I am not for condemning them to more than perpetual banishment, because, at any rate, they have some share in the invention of the famous Matteo Boiardo, whence too the Christian poet Ludovico Ariosto wove his web, to whom, if I find him here, and speaking any language but his own, I shall show no respect whatever; but if he speaks his own tongue I will put him upon my head.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I have him in Italian,\u201d said the barber, \u201cbut I do not understand him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor would it be well that you should understand him,\u201d said the curate, \u201cand on that score we might have excused the Captain if he had not brought him into Spain and turned him into Castilian. He robbed him of a great deal of his natural force, and so do all those who try to turn books written in verse into another language, for, with all the pains they take and all the cleverness they show, they never can reach the level of the originals as they were first produced. In short, I say that this book, and all that may be found treating of those French affairs, should be thrown into or deposited in some dry well, until after more consideration it is settled what is to be done with them; excepting always one \u2018Bernardo del Carpio\u2019 that is going about, and another called \u2018Roncesvalles;\u2019 for these, if they come into my hands, shall pass at once into those of the housekeeper, and from hers into the fire without any reprieve.\u201d\n\nTo all this the barber gave his assent, and looked upon it as right and proper, being persuaded that the curate was so staunch to the Faith and loyal to the Truth that he would not for the world say anything opposed to them. Opening another book he saw it was \u201cPalmerin de Oliva,\u201d and beside it was another called \u201cPalmerin of England,\u201d seeing which the licentiate said, \u201cLet the Olive be made firewood of at once and burned until no ashes even are left; and let that Palm of England be kept and preserved as a thing that stands alone, and let such another case be made for it as that which Alexander found among the spoils of Darius and set aside for the safe keeping of the works of the poet Homer. This book, gossip, is of authority for two reasons, first because it is very good, and secondly because it is said to have been written by a wise and witty king of Portugal. All the adventures at the Castle of Miraguarda are excellent and of admirable contrivance, and the language is polished and clear, studying and observing the style befitting the speaker with propriety and judgment. So then, provided it seems good to you, Master Nicholas, I say let this and \u2018Amadis of Gaul\u2019 be remitted the penalty of fire, and as for all the rest, let them perish without further question or query.\u201d\n\n\u201cNay, gossip,\u201d said the barber, \u201cfor this that I have here is the famous \u2018Don Belianis.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the curate, \u201cthat and the second, third, and fourth parts all stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile, and they must be cleared of all that stuff about the Castle of Fame and other greater affectations, to which end let them be allowed the over-seas term, and, according as they mend, so shall mercy or justice be meted out to them; and in the mean time, gossip, do you keep them in your house and let no one read them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all my heart,\u201d said the barber; and not caring to tire himself with reading more books of chivalry, he told the housekeeper to take all the big ones and throw them into the yard. It was not said to one dull or deaf, but to one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving the broadest and finest web that could be; and seizing about eight at a time, she flung them out of the window.\n\nIn carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of the barber, who took it up, curious to know whose it was, and found it said, \u201cHistory of the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod bless me!\u201d said the curate with a shout, \u201c\u2018Tirante el Blanco\u2019 here! Hand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon I have found a treasury of enjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don Kyrieleison of Montalvan, a valiant knight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, and the knight Fonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought with the mastiff, and the witticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the loves and wiles of the widow Reposada, and the empress in love with the squire Hipolito\u2014in truth, gossip, by right of its style it is the best book in the world. Here knights eat and sleep, and die in their beds, and make their wills before dying, and a great deal more of which there is nothing in all the other books. Nevertheless, I say he who wrote it, for deliberately composing such fooleries, deserves to be sent to the galleys for life. Take it home with you and read it, and you will see that what I have said is true.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you will,\u201d said the barber; \u201cbut what are we to do with these little books that are left?\u201d\n\n\u201cThese must be, not chivalry, but poetry,\u201d said the curate; and opening one he saw it was the \u201cDiana\u201d of Jorge de Montemayor, and, supposing all the others to be of the same sort, \u201cthese,\u201d he said, \u201cdo not deserve to be burned like the others, for they neither do nor can do the mischief the books of chivalry have done, being books of entertainment that can hurt no one.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, se\xf1or!\u201d said the niece, \u201cyour worship had better order these to be burned as well as the others; for it would be no wonder if, after being cured of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took a fancy to turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing and piping; or, what would be still worse, to turn poet, which they say is an incurable and infectious malady.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe damsel is right,\u201d said the curate, \u201cand it will be well to put this stumbling-block and temptation out of our friend\u2019s way. To begin, then, with the \u2018Diana\u2019 of Montemayor. I am of opinion it should not be burned, but that it should be cleared of all that about the sage Felicia and the magic water, and of almost all the longer pieces of verse: let it keep, and welcome, its prose and the honour of being the first of books of the kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis that comes next,\u201d said the barber, \u201cis the \u2018Diana,\u2019 entitled the \u2018Second Part, by the Salamancan,\u2019 and this other has the same title, and its author is Gil Polo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for that of the Salamancan,\u201d replied the curate, \u201clet it go to swell the number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil Polo\u2019s be preserved as if it came from Apollo himself: but get on, gossip, and make haste, for it is growing late.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis book,\u201d said the barber, opening another, \u201cis the ten books of the \u2018Fortune of Love,\u2019 written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian poet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the orders I have received,\u201d said the curate, \u201csince Apollo has been Apollo, and the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been poets, so droll and absurd a book as this has never been written, and in its way it is the best and the most singular of all of this species that have as yet appeared, and he who has not read it may be sure he has never read what is delightful. Give it here, gossip, for I make more account of having found it than if they had given me a cassock of Florence stuff.\u201d\n\nHe put it aside with extreme satisfaction, and the barber went on, \u201cThese that come next are \u2018The Shepherd of Iberia,\u2019 \u2018Nymphs of Henares,\u2019 and \u2018The Enlightenment of Jealousy.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThen all we have to do,\u201d said the curate, \u201cis to hand them over to the secular arm of the housekeeper, and ask me not why, or we shall never have done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis next is the \u2018Pastor de F\xedlida.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cNo Pastor that,\u201d said the curate, \u201cbut a highly polished courtier; let it be preserved as a precious jewel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis large one here,\u201d said the barber, \u201cis called \u2018The Treasury of various Poems.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there were not so many of them,\u201d said the curate, \u201cthey would be more relished: this book must be weeded and cleansed of certain vulgarities which it has with its excellences; let it be preserved because the author is a friend of mine, and out of respect for other more heroic and loftier works that he has written.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d continued the barber, \u201cis the \u2018Cancionero\u2019 of Lopez de Maldonado.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe author of that book, too,\u201d said the curate, \u201cis a great friend of mine, and his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all who hear them, for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants when he chants them: it gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what is good was never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have been set apart. But what book is that next it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Galatea\u2019 of Miguel de Cervantes,\u201d said the barber.\n\n\u201cThat Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to my knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses. His book has some good invention in it, it presents us with something but brings nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part it promises: perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full measure of grace that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you, se\xf1or gossip, keep it shut up in your own quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said the barber; \u201cand here come three together, the \u2018Araucana\u2019 of Don Alonso de Ercilla, the \u2018Austriada\u2019 of Juan Rufo, Justice of Cordova, and the \u2018Montserrate\u2019 of Christobal de Viru\xe9s, the Valencian poet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese three books,\u201d said the curate, \u201care the best that have been written in Castilian in heroic verse, and they may compare with the most famous of Italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures of poetry that Spain possesses.\u201d\n\nThe curate was tired and would not look into any more books, and so he decided that, \u201ccontents uncertified,\u201d all the rest should be burned; but just then the barber held open one, called \u201cThe Tears of Angelica.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should have shed tears myself,\u201d said the curate when he heard the title, \u201chad I ordered that book to be burned, for its author was one of the famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happy in the translation of some of Ovid\u2019s fables.\u201d\nc06e.jpg (30K)\nCHAPTER VII.\nOF THE SECOND SALLY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA\nc07a.jpg (151K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nAt this instant Don Quixote began shouting out, \u201cHere, here, valiant knights! here is need for you to put forth the might of your strong arms, for they of the Court are gaining the mastery in the tourney!\u201d Called away by this noise and outcry, they proceeded no farther with the scrutiny of the remaining books, and so it is thought that \u201cThe Carolea,\u201d \u201cThe Lion of Spain,\u201d and \u201cThe Deeds of the Emperor,\u201d written by Don Luis de \xc1vila, went to the fire unseen and unheard; for no doubt they were among those that remained, and perhaps if the curate had seen them they would not have undergone so severe a sentence.\n\nWhen they reached Don Quixote he was already out of bed, and was still shouting and raving, and slashing and cutting all round, as wide awake as if he had never slept.\n\nThey closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when he had become a little calm, addressing the curate, he said to him, \u201cOf a truth, Se\xf1or Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who call ourselves the Twelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of the Court to gain the victory in this tourney, we the adventurers having carried off the honour on the three former days.\u201d\n\n\u201cHush, gossip,\u201d said the curate; \u201cplease God, the luck may turn, and what is lost to-day may be won to-morrow; for the present let your worship have a care of your health, for it seems to me that you are over-fatigued, if not badly wounded.\u201d\n\n\u201cWounded no,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cbut bruised and battered no doubt, for that bastard Don Roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree, and all for envy, because he sees that I alone rival him in his achievements. But I should not call myself Reinaldos of Montalvan did he not pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon as I rise from this bed. For the present let them bring me something to eat, for that, I feel, is what will be more to my purpose, and leave it to me to avenge myself.\u201d\n\nThey did as he wished; they gave him something to eat, and once more he fell asleep, leaving them marvelling at his madness.\n\nThat night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the books that were in the yard and in the whole house; and some must have been consumed that deserved preservation in everlasting archives, but their fate and the laziness of the examiner did not permit it, and so in them was verified the proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty.\n\nOne of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately applied to their friend\u2019s disorder was to wall up and plaster the room where the books were, so that when he got up he should not find them (possibly the cause being removed the effect might cease), and they might say that a magician had carried them off, room and all; and this was done with all despatch. Two days later Don Quixote got up, and the first thing he did was to go and look at his books, and not finding the room where he had left it, he wandered from side to side looking for it. He came to the place where the door used to be, and tried it with his hands, and turned and twisted his eyes in every direction without saying a word; but after a good while he asked his housekeeper whereabouts was the room that held his books.\n\nThe housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she was to answer, said, \u201cWhat room or what nothing is it that your worship is looking for? There are neither room nor books in this house now, for the devil himself has carried all away.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not the devil,\u201d said the niece, \u201cbut a magician who came on a cloud one night after the day your worship left this, and dismounting from a serpent that he rode he entered the room, and what he did there I know not, but after a little while he made off, flying through the roof, and left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what he had done we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, the housekeeper and I, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loud voice that, for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the room, he had done mischief in that house that would be discovered by-and-by: he said too that his name was the Sage Mu\xf1aton.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe must have said Friston,\u201d said Don Quixote.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether he called himself Friston or Friton,\u201d said the housekeeper, \u201cI only know that his name ended with \u2018ton.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it does,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand he is a sage magician, a great enemy of mine, who has a spite against me because he knows by his arts and lore that in process of time I am to engage in single combat with a knight whom he befriends and that I am to conquer, and he will be unable to prevent it; and for this reason he endeavours to do me all the ill turns that he can; but I promise him it will be hard for him to oppose or avoid what is decreed by Heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho doubts that?\u201d said the niece; \u201cbut, uncle, who mixes you up in these quarrels? Would it not be better to remain at peace in your own house instead of roaming the world looking for better bread than ever came of wheat, never reflecting that many go for wool and come back shorn?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, niece of mine,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201chow much astray art thou in thy reckoning: ere they shear me I shall have plucked away and stripped off the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of mine.\u201d\n\nThe two were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that his anger was kindling.\n\nIn short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly without showing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions, and during this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips, the curate and the barber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errant were what the world stood most in need of, and that in him was to be accomplished the revival of knight-errantry. The curate sometimes contradicted him, sometimes agreed with him, for if he had not observed this precaution he would have been unable to bring him to reason.\n\nMeanwhile Don Quixote worked upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his, an honest man (if indeed that title can be given to him who is poor), but with very little wit in his pate. In a word, he so talked him over, and with such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up his mind to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. Don Quixote, among other things, told him he ought to be ready to go with him gladly, because any moment an adventure might occur that might win an island in the twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it. On these and the like promises Sancho Panza (for so the labourer was called) left wife and children, and engaged himself as esquire to his neighbour.\nc07b.jpg (322K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nDon Quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing and pawning another, and making a bad bargain in every case, he got together a fair sum. He provided himself with a buckler, which he begged as a loan from a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet as best he could, he warned his squire Sancho of the day and hour he meant to set out, that he might provide himself with what he thought most needful. Above all, he charged him to take alforjas with him. The other said he would, and that he meant to take also a very good ass he had, as he was not much given to going on foot. About the ass, Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying whether he could call to mind any knight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back, but no instance occurred to his memory. For all that, however, he determined to take him, intending to furnish him with a more honourable mount when a chance of it presented itself, by appropriating the horse of the first discourteous knight he encountered. Himself he provided with shirts and such other things as he could, according to the advice the host had given him; all which being done, without taking leave, Sancho Panza of his wife and children, or Don Quixote of his housekeeper and niece, they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night, and made such good way in the course of it that by daylight they held themselves safe from discovery, even should search be made for them.\n\nSancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and bota, and longing to see himself soon governor of the island his master had promised him. Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and road he had taken on his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel, which he travelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for, as it was early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely, the heat did not distress them.\n\nAnd now said Sancho Panza to his master, \u201cYour worship will take care, Se\xf1or Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promised me, for be it ever so big I\u2019ll be equal to governing it.\u201d\n\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \u201cThou must know, friend Sancho Panza, that it was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant of old to make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they won, and I am determined that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal a custom; on the contrary, I mean to improve upon it, for they sometimes, and perhaps most frequently, waited until their squires were old, and then when they had had enough of service and hard days and worse nights, they gave them some title or other, of count, or at the most marquis, of some valley or province more or less; but if thou livest and I live, it may well be that before six days are over, I may have won some kingdom that has others dependent upon it, which will be just the thing to enable thee to be crowned king of one of them. Nor needst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to the lot of such knights in ways so unexampled and unexpected that I might easily give thee even more than I promise thee.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d said Sancho Panza, \u201cif I should become a king by one of those miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old woman, would come to be queen and my children infantes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, who doubts it?\u201d said Don Quixote.\n\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d replied Sancho Panza, \u201cbecause for my part I am persuaded that though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them would fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, se\xf1or, she is not worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and that only with God\u2019s help.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave it to God, Sancho,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cfor he will give her what suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come to be content with anything less than being governor of a province.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not, se\xf1or,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cspecially as I have a man of such quality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give me all that will be suitable for me and that I can bear.\u201d\nc07e.jpg (70K)\nCHAPTER VIII.\nOF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE TERRIBLE AND UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE WINDMILLS, WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES WORTHY TO BE FITLY RECORDED\nc08a.jpg (142K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nAt this point they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills that there are on that plain, and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he said to his squire, \u201cFortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our desires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza, where thirty or more monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom I mean to engage in battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin to make our fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God\u2019s good service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat giants?\u201d said Sancho Panza.\n\n\u201cThose thou seest there,\u201d answered his master, \u201cwith the long arms, and some have them nearly two leagues long.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, your worship,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cwhat we see there are not giants but windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by the wind make the millstone go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is easy to see,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cthat thou art not used to this business of adventures; those are giants; and if thou art afraid, away with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage them in fierce and unequal combat.\u201d\n\nSo saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the cries his squire Sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainly they were windmills and not giants he was going to attack. He, however, was so positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of Sancho, nor perceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at them shouting, \u201cFly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight attacks you.\u201d\n\nA slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to move, seeing which Don Quixote exclaimed, \u201cThough ye flourish more arms than the giant Briareus, ye have to reckon with me.\u201d\n\nSo saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his lady Dulcinea, imploring her to support him in such a peril, with lance in rest and covered by his buckler, he charged at Rocinante\u2019s fullest gallop and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but as he drove his lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round with such force that it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horse and rider, who went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition. Sancho hastened to his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and when he came up found him unable to move, with such a shock had Rocinante fallen with him.\nc08b.jpg (358K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\n\u201cGod bless me!\u201d said Sancho, \u201cdid I not tell your worship to mind what you were about, for they were only windmills? and no one could have made any mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind in his head.\u201d\n\n\u201cHush, friend Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cthe fortunes of war more than any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover I think, and it is the truth, that that same sage Friston who carried off my study and books, has turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the glory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he bears me; but in the end his wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword.\u201d\nc08c.jpg (301K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\n\u201cGod order it as he may,\u201d said Sancho Panza, and helping him to rise got him up again on Rocinante, whose shoulder was half out; and then, discussing the late adventure, they followed the road to Puerto Lapice, for there, said Don Quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in abundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare. For all that, he was much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire, he added, \u201cI remember having read how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez de Vargas by name, having broken his sword in battle, tore from an oak a ponderous bough or branch, and with it did such things that day, and pounded so many Moors, that he got the surname of Machuca, and he and his descendants from that day forth were called Vargas y Machuca. I mention this because from the first oak I see I mean to rend such another branch, large and stout like that, with which I am determined and resolved to do such deeds that thou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in being found worthy to come and see them, and be an eyewitness of things that will with difficulty be believed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe that as God will,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cI believe it all as your worship says it; but straighten yourself a little, for you seem all on one side, may be from the shaking of the fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the truth,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand if I make no complaint of the pain it is because knights-errant are not permitted to complain of any wound, even though their bowels be coming out through it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf so,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cI have nothing to say; but God knows I would rather your worship complained when anything ailed you. For my part, I confess I must complain however small the ache may be; unless this rule about not complaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also.\u201d\n\nDon Quixote could not help laughing at his squire\u2019s simplicity, and he assured him he might complain whenever and however he chose, just as he liked, for, so far, he had never read of anything to the contrary in the order of knighthood.\n\nSancho bade him remember it was dinner-time, to which his master answered that he wanted nothing himself just then, but that he might eat when he had a mind. With this permission Sancho settled himself as comfortably as he could on his beast, and taking out of the alforjas what he had stowed away in them, he jogged along behind his master munching deliberately, and from time to time taking a pull at the bota with a relish that the thirstiest tapster in Malaga might have envied; and while he went on in this way, gulping down draught after draught, he never gave a thought to any of the promises his master had made him, nor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreation going in quest of adventures, however dangerous they might be. Finally they passed the night among some trees, from one of which Don Quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him after a fashion as a lance, and fixed on it the head he had removed from the broken one. All that night Don Quixote lay awake thinking of his lady Dulcinea, in order to conform to what he had read in his books, how many a night in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless supported by the memory of their mistresses. Not so did Sancho Panza spend it, for having his stomach full of something stronger than chicory water he made but one sleep of it, and, if his master had not called him, neither the rays of the sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes of the birds welcoming the approach of day would have had power to waken him. On getting up he tried the bota and found it somewhat less full than the night before, which grieved his heart because they did not seem to be on the way to remedy the deficiency readily. Don Quixote did not care to break his fast, for, as has been already said, he confined himself to savoury recollections for nourishment.\n\nThey returned to the road they had set out with, leading to Puerto Lapice, and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. \u201cHere, brother Sancho Panza,\u201d said Don Quixote when he saw it, \u201cwe may plunge our hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe, even shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thou must not put a hand to thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thou perceivest that those who assail me are rabble or base folk; for in that case thou mayest very properly aid me; but if they be knights it is on no account permitted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood to help me until thou hast been dubbed a knight.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost certainly, se\xf1or,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cyour worship shall be fully obeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself I am peaceful and no friend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the defence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws, for laws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against any assailant whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I grant,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cbut in this matter of aiding me against knights thou must put a restraint upon thy natural impetuosity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will do so, I promise you,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cand will keep this precept as carefully as Sunday.\u201d\n\nWhile they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of the order of St. Benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not less tall were the two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectacles and carried sunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or five persons on horseback and two muleteers on foot. In the coach there was, as afterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, where her husband was about to take passage for the Indies with an appointment of high honour. The friars, though going the same road, were not in her company; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them he said to his squire, \u201cEither I am mistaken, or this is going to be the most famous adventure that has ever been seen, for those black bodies we see there must be, and doubtless are, magicians who are carrying off some stolen princess in that coach, and with all my might I must undo this wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will be worse than the windmills,\u201d said Sancho. \u201cLook, se\xf1or; those are friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to some travellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don\u2019t let the devil mislead you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have told thee already, Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cthat on the subject of adventures thou knowest little. What I say is the truth, as thou shalt see presently.\u201d\n\nSo saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road along which the friars were coming, and as soon as he thought they had come near enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, \u201cDevilish and unnatural beings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you are carrying off by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedy death as the just punishment of your evil deeds.\u201d\n\nThe friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of Don Quixote as well as at his words, to which they replied, \u201cSe\xf1or Caballero, we are not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St. Benedict following our road, nor do we know whether or not there are any captive princesses coming in this coach.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,\u201d said Don Quixote, and without waiting for a reply he spurred Rocinante and with levelled lance charged the first friar with such fury and determination, that, if the friar had not flung himself off the mule, he would have brought him to the ground against his will, and sore wounded, if not killed outright. The second brother, seeing how his comrade was treated, drove his heels into his castle of a mule and made off across the country faster than the wind.\n\nSancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly from his ass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. At that instant the friars\u2019 muleteers came up and asked what he was stripping him for. Sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully as spoil of the battle which his lord Don Quixote had won. The muleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all this about battles and spoils, seeing that Don Quixote was some distance off talking to the travellers in the coach, fell upon Sancho, knocked him down, and leaving hardly a hair in his beard, belaboured him with kicks and left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; and without any more delay helped the friar to mount, who, trembling, terrified, and pale, as soon as he found himself in the saddle, spurred after his companion, who was standing at a distance looking on, watching the result of the onslaught; then, not caring to wait for the end of the affair just begun, they pursued their journey making more crosses than if they had the devil after them.\n\nDon Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach: \u201cYour beauty, lady mine,\u201d said he, \u201cmay now dispose of your person as may be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your ravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine; and lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know that I am called Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and adventurer, and captive to the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del Toboso: and in return for the service you have received of me I ask no more than that you should return to El Toboso, and on my behalf present yourself before that lady and tell her what I have done to set you free.\u201d\n\nOne of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was listening to all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he would not allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to El Toboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad Castilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion, \u201cBegone, caballero, and ill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach, slayest thee as art here a Biscayan.\u201d\n\nDon Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly, \u201cIf thou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have already chastised thy folly and rashness, miserable creature.\u201d To which the Biscayan returned, \u201cI no gentleman!\u2014I swear to God thou liest as I am Christian: if thou droppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt thou see thou art carrying water to the cat: Biscayan on land, hidalgo at sea, hidalgo at the devil, and look, if thou sayest otherwise thou liest.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018\u201cYou will see presently,\u201d said Agrajes,\u2019\u201d replied Don Quixote; and throwing his lance on the ground he drew his sword, braced his buckler on his arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking his life.\n\nThe Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismount from his mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out for hire, he had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it was lucky for him, however, that he was near the coach, from which he was able to snatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went at one another as if they had been two mortal enemies. The others strove to make peace between them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared in his disjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he would kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him. The lady in the coach, amazed and terrified at what she saw, ordered the coachman to draw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severe struggle, in the course of which the Biscayan smote Don Quixote a mighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his buckler, which, given to one without armour, would have cleft him to the waist. Don Quixote, feeling the weight of this prodigious blow, cried aloud, saying, \u201cO lady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the aid of this your knight, who, in fulfilling his obligations to your beauty, finds himself in this extreme peril.\u201d To say this, to lift his sword, to shelter himself well behind his buckler, and to assail the Biscayan was the work of an instant, determined as he was to venture all upon a single blow. The Biscayan, seeing him come on in this way, was convinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and resolved to follow his example, so he waited for him keeping well under cover of his cushion, being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his mule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of game, could not stir a step.\n\nOn, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan, with uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half, while on his side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and under the protection of his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting in suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall, and the lady in the coach and the rest of her following were making a thousand vows and offerings to all the images and shrines of Spain, that God might deliver her squire and all of them from this great peril in which they found themselves. But it spoils all, that at this point and crisis the author of the history leaves this battle impending, giving as excuse that he could find nothing more written about these achievements of Don Quixote than what has been already set forth. It is true the second author of this work was unwilling to believe that a history so curious could have been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion, or that the wits of La Mancha could have been so undiscerning as not to preserve in their archives or registries some documents referring to this famous knight; and this being his persuasion, he did not despair of finding the conclusion of this pleasant history, which, heaven favouring him, he did find in a way that shall be related in the Second Part.\nc08e.jpg (54K)\nCHAPTER IX.\nIN WHICH IS CONCLUDED AND FINISHED THE TERRIFIC BATTLE BETWEEN THE GALLANT BISCAYAN AND THE VALIANT MANCHEGAN\nc09a.jpg (142K)\n\nFull Size\n\n\n\nIn the First Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and the renowned Don Quixote with drawn swords uplifted, ready to deliver two such furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they would at least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and laid them open like a pomegranate; and at this so critical point the delightful history came to a stop and stood cut short without any intimation from the author where what was missing was to be found.\n\nThis distressed me greatly, because the pleasure derived from having read such a small portion turned to vexation at the thought of the poor chance that presented itself of finding the large part that, so it seemed to me, was missing of such an interesting tale. It appeared to me to be a thing impossible and contrary to all precedent that so good a knight should have been without some sage to undertake the task of writing his marvellous achievements; a thing that was never wanting to any of those knights-errant who, they say, went after adventures; for every one of them had one or two sages as if made on purpose, who not only recorded their deeds but described their most trifling thoughts and follies, however secret they might be; and such a good knight could not have been so unfortunate as not to have what Platir and others like him had in abundance. And so I could not bring myself to believe that such a gallant tale had been left maimed and mutilated, and I laid the blame on Time, the devourer and destroyer of all things, that had either concealed or consumed it.\n\nOn the other hand, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his books there had been found such modern ones as \u201cThe Enlightenment of Jealousy\u201d and the \u201cNymphs and Shepherds of Henares,\u201d his story must likewise be modern, and that though it might not be written, it might exist in the memory of the people of his village and of those in the neighbourhood. This reflection kept me perplexed and longing to know really and truly the whole life and wondrous deeds of our famous Spaniard, Don Quixote of La Mancha, light and mirror of Manchegan chivalry, and the first that in our age and in these so evil days devoted himself to the labour and exercise of the arms of knight-errantry, righting wrongs, succouring widows, and protecting damsels of that sort that used to ride about, whip in hand, on their palfreys, with all their virginity about them, from mountain to mountain and valley to valley\u2014for, if it were not for some ruffian, or boor with a hood and hatchet, or monstrous giant, that forced them, there were in days of yore damsels that at the end of eighty years, in all which time they had never slept a day under a roof, went to their graves as much maids as the mothers that bore them. I say, then, that in these and other respects our gallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and notable praise, nor should it be withheld even from me for the labour and pains spent in searching for the conclusion of this delightful history; though I know well that if Heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped me, the world would have remained deprived of an entertainment and pleasure that for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall read it attentively. The discovery of it occurred in this way.\n\nOne day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell some pamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer, and, as I am fond of reading even the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bent of mine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and saw that it was in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and as I was unable to read them though I could recognise them, I looked about to see if there were any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them for me; nor was there any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter, for even had I sought one for an older and better language I should have found him. In short, chance provided me with one, who when I told him what I wanted and put the book into his hands, opened it in the middle and after reading a little in it began to laugh. I asked him what he was laughing at, and he replied that it was at something the book had written in the margin by way of a note. I bade him tell it to me; and he still laughing said, \u201cIn the margin, as I told you, this is written: \u2018This Dulcinea del Toboso so often mentioned in this history, had, they say, the best hand of any woman in all La Mancha for salting pigs.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise and amazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained the history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to read the beginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, he told me it meant, \u201cHistory of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by Cid Hamete Benengeli, an Arab historian.\u201d It required great caution to hide the joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, and snatching it from the silk mercer, I bought all the papers and pamphlets from the boy for half a real; and if he had had his wits about him and had known how eager I was for them, he might have safely calculated on making more than six reals by the bargain. I withdrew at once with the Morisco into the cloister of the cathedral, and begged him to turn all these pamphlets that related to Don Quixote into the Castilian tongue, without omitting or adding anything to them, offering him whatever payment he pleased. He was satisfied with two arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat, and promised to translate them faithfully and with all despatch; but to make the matter easier, and not to let such a precious find out of my hands, I took him to my house, where in little more than a month and a half he translated the whole just as it is set down here.\n\nIn the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan was drawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the history describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his buckler, the other by his cushion, and the Biscayan\u2019s mule so true to nature that it could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. The Biscayan had an inscription under his feet which said, \u201cDon Sancho de Azpeitia,\u201d which no doubt must have been his name; and at the feet of Rocinante was another that said, \u201cDon Quixote.\u201d Rocinante was marvellously portrayed, so long and thin, so lank and lean, with so much backbone and so far gone in consumption, that he showed plainly with what judgment and propriety the name of Rocinante had been bestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho Panza holding the halter of his ass, at whose feet was another label that said, \u201cSancho Zancas,\u201d and according to the picture, he must have had a big belly, a short body, and long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the names of Panza and Zancas were given him, for by these two surnames the history several times calls him. Some other trifling particulars might be mentioned, but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do with the true relation of the history; and no history can be bad so long as it is true.\n\nIf against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its truth, it can only be that its author was an Arab, as lying is a very common propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are such enemies of ours, it is conceivable that there were omissions rather than additions made in the course of it. And this is my own opinion; for, where he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so worthy a knight, he seems to me deliberately to pass it over in silence; which is ill done and worse contrived, for it is the business and duty of historians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free from passion, and neither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should make them swerve from the path of truth, whose mother is history, rival of time, storehouse of deeds, witness for the past, example and counsel for the present, and warning for the future. In this I know will be found all that can be desired in the pleasantest, and if it be wanting in any good quality, I maintain it is the fault of its hound of an author and not the fault of the subject. To be brief, its Second Part, according to the translation, began in this way:\n\nWith trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as though the two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven, and earth, and hell, with such resolution and determination did they bear themselves. The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, which was delivered with such force and fury that had not the sword turned in its course, that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the bitter struggle and to all the adventures of our knight; but that good fortune which reserved him for greater things, turned aside the sword of his adversary, so that although it smote him upon the left shoulder, it did him no more harm than to strip all that side of its armour, carrying away a great part of his helmet with half of his ear, all which with fearful ruin fell to the ground, leaving him in a sorry plight.\n\nGood God! Who is there that could properly describe the rage that filled the heart of our Manchegan when he saw himself dealt with in this fashion? All that can be said is, it was such that he again raised himself in his stirrups, and, grasping his sword more firmly with both hands, he came down on the Biscayan with such fury, smiting him full over the cushion and over the head, that\u2014even so good a shield proving useless\u2014as if a mountain had fallen on him, he began to bleed from nose, mouth, and ears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from his mule, as no doubt he would have done had he not flung his arms about its neck; at the same time, however, he slipped his feet out of the stirrups and then unclasped his arms, and the mule, taking fright at the terrible blow, made off across the plain, and with a few plunges flung its master to the ground. Don Quixote stood looking on very calmly, and, when he saw him fall, leaped from his horse and with great briskness ran to him, and, presenting the point of his sword to his eyes, bade him surrender, or he would cut his head off. The Biscayan was so bewildered that he was unable to answer a word, and it would have gone hard with him, so blind was Don Quixote, had not the ladies in the coach, who had hitherto been watching the combat in great terror, hastened to where he stood and implored him with earnest entreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing their squire\u2019s life; to which Don Quixote replied with much gravity and dignity, \u201cIn truth, fair ladies, I am well content to do what ye ask of me; but it must be on one condition and understanding, which is that this knight promise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on my behalf present himself before the peerless lady Dulcinea, that she deal with him as shall be most pleasing to her.\u201d\n\nThe terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote\u2019s demand or asking who Dulcinea might be, promised that their squire should do all that had been commanded.\n\n\u201cThen, on the faith of that promise,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI shall do him no further harm, though he well deserves it of me.\u201d "},{title:"Jane Eyre: An Autobiography",author:"Charlotte Bront\xeb",gender:"Female",text:" There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question.\n\nI was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.\n\nThe said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying, \u201cShe regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner\u2014something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were\u2014she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does Bessie say I have done?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cJane, I don\u2019t like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.\u201d\n\nA breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.\n\nFolds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.\n\nI returned to my book\u2014Bewick\u2019s History of British Birds: the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of \u201cthe solitary rocks and promontories\u201d by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape\u2014\n\n\u201cWhere the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,\nBoils round the naked, melancholy isles\nOf farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge\nPours in among the stormy Hebrides.\u201d\n\nNor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with \u201cthe vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,\u2014that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.\u201d Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children\u2019s brains, but strangely impressive. The words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.\n\nI cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of eventide.\n\nThe two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.\n\nThe fiend pinning down the thief\u2019s pack behind him, I passed over quickly: it was an object of terror.\n\nSo was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows.\n\nEach picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed\u2019s lace frills, and crimped her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.\n\nWith Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way. I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The breakfast-room door opened.\n\n\u201cBoh! Madam Mope!\u201d cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he found the room apparently empty.\n\n\u201cWhere the dickens is she!\u201d he continued. \u201cLizzy! Georgy! (calling to his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain\u2014bad animal!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is well I drew the curtain,\u201d thought I; and I wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just put her head in at the door, and said at once\u2014\n\n\u201cShe is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.\u201d\n\nAnd I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said Jack.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked, with awkward diffidence.\n\n\u201cSay, \u2018What do you want, Master Reed?\u2019\u201d was the answer. \u201cI want you to come here;\u201d and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.\n\nJohn Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two, \u201con account of his delicate health.\u201d Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother\u2019s heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John\u2019s sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after home.\n\nJohn had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near. There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind her back.\n\nHabitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it. I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair.\n\n\u201cThat is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,\u201d said he, \u201cand for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!\u201d\n\nAccustomed to John Reed\u2019s abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult.\n\n\u201cWhat were you doing behind the curtain?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI was reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cShow the book.\u201d\n\nI returned to the window and fetched it thence.\n\n\u201cYou have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen\u2019s children like us, and eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama\u2019s expense. Now, I\u2019ll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they are mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows.\u201d\n\nI did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded.\n\n\u201cWicked and cruel boy!\u201d I said. \u201cYou are like a murderer\u2014you are like a slave-driver\u2014you are like the Roman emperors!\u201d\n\nI had read Goldsmith\u2019s History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of Nero, Caligula, &c. Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never thought thus to have declared aloud.\n\n\u201cWhat! what!\u201d he cried. \u201cDid she say that to me? Did you hear her, Eliza and Georgiana? Won\u2019t I tell mama? but first\u2014\u201d\n\nHe ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had closed with a desperate thing. I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort. I don\u2019t very well know what I did with my hands, but he called me \u201cRat! Rat!\u201d and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted: I heard the words\u2014\n\n\u201cDear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!\u201d\n\n\u201cDid ever anybody see such a picture of passion!\u201d\n\nThen Mrs. Reed subjoined\u2014\n\n\u201cTake her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.\u201d Four hands were immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.\nCHAPTER II\n\nI resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather out of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment\u2019s mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.\n\n\u201cHold her arms, Miss Abbot: she\u2019s like a mad cat.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor shame! for shame!\u201d cried the lady\u2019s-maid. \u201cWhat shocking conduct, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress\u2019s son! Your young master.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaster! How is he my master? Am I a servant?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep. There, sit down, and think over your wickedness.\u201d\n\nThey had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t sit still, you must be tied down,\u201d said Bessie. \u201cMiss Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.\u201d\n\nMiss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature. This preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a little of the excitement out of me.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take them off,\u201d I cried; \u201cI will not stir.\u201d\n\nIn guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.\n\n\u201cMind you don\u2019t,\u201d said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as incredulous of my sanity.\n\n\u201cShe never did so before,\u201d at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.\n\n\u201cBut it was always in her,\u201d was the reply. \u201cI\u2019ve told Missis often my opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me. She\u2019s an underhand little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover.\u201d\n\nBessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said\u2014\n\n\u201cYou ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse.\u201d\n\nI had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind. This reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very painful and crushing, but only half intelligible. Miss Abbot joined in\u2014\n\n\u201cAnd you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them. They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we tell you is for your good,\u201d added Bessie, in no harsh voice, \u201cyou should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you away, I am sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides,\u201d said Miss Abbot, \u201cGod will punish her: He might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go? Come, Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn\u2019t have her heart for anything. Say your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don\u2019t repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and fetch you away.\u201d\n\nThey went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.\n\nThe red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion. A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre; the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red; the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany. Out of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane. Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.\n\nThis room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be so seldom entered. The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week\u2019s quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room\u2014the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur.\n\nMr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the undertaker\u2019s men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion.\n\nMy seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted, was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room. I was not quite sure whether they had locked the door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see. Alas! yes: no jail was ever more secure. Returning, I had to cross before the looking-glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed. All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie\u2019s evening stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my stool.\n\nSuperstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.\n\nAll John Reed\u2019s violent tyrannies, all his sisters\u2019 proud indifference, all his mother\u2019s aversion, all the servants\u2019 partiality, turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well. Why was I always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned? Why could I never please? Why was it useless to try to win any one\u2019s favour? Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected. Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage, was universally indulged. Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase indemnity for every fault. John no one thwarted, much less punished; though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks, set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit, and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called his mother \u201cold girl,\u201d too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin, similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still \u201cher own darling.\u201d I dared commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to night.\n\nMy head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with general opprobrium.\n\n\u201cUnjust!\u2014unjust!\u201d said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression\u2014as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.\n\nWhat a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon! How all my brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection! Yet in what darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I could not answer the ceaseless inward question\u2014why I thus suffered; now, at the distance of\u2014I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.\n\nI was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage. If they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them. They were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment. I know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child\u2014though equally dependent and friendless\u2014Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.\n\nDaylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o\u2019clock, and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. I heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then my courage sank. My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? That certainly was a crime: and was I fit to die? Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne? In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with gathering dread. I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own uncle\u2014my mother\u2019s brother\u2014that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children. Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had, I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her, after her husband\u2019s death, by any tie? It must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group.\n\nA singular notion dawned upon me. I doubted not\u2014never doubted\u2014that if Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls\u2014occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaming mirror\u2014I began to recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed\u2019s spirit, harassed by the wrongs of his sister\u2019s child, might quit its abode\u2014whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed\u2014and rise before me in this chamber. I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed face, bending over me with strange pity. This idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I endeavoured to stifle it\u2014I endeavoured to be firm. Shaking my hair from my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room; at this moment a light gleamed on the wall. Was it, I asked myself, a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my head. I can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world. My heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort. Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.\n\n\u201cMiss Eyre, are you ill?\u201d said Bessie.\n\n\u201cWhat a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!\u201d exclaimed Abbot.\n\n\u201cTake me out! Let me go into the nursery!\u201d was my cry.\n\n\u201cWhat for? Are you hurt? Have you seen something?\u201d again demanded Bessie.\n\n\u201cOh! I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come.\u201d I had now got hold of Bessie\u2019s hand, and she did not snatch it from me.\n\n\u201cShe has screamed out on purpose,\u201d declared Abbot, in some disgust. \u201cAnd what a scream! If she had been in great pain one would have excused it, but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is all this?\u201d demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily. \u201cAbbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left in the red-room till I came to her myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Jane screamed so loud, ma\u2019am,\u201d pleaded Bessie.\n\n\u201cLet her go,\u201d was the only answer. \u201cLoose Bessie\u2019s hand, child: you cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured. I abhor artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you then.\u201d\n\n\u201cO aunt! have pity! Forgive me! I cannot endure it\u2014let me be punished some other way! I shall be killed if\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSilence! This violence is all most repulsive:\u201d and so, no doubt, she felt it. I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous duplicity.\n\nBessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without farther parley. I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone, I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed with thick black bars. I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation, uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my faculties. Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me; lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before. I rested my head against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.\n\nIn five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery fire. It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow, leaning over me.\n\nI felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed. Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary, sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for herself and the children she employed a physician.\n\n\u201cWell, who am I?\u201d he asked.\n\nI pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it, smiling and saying, \u201cWe shall do very well by-and-by.\u201d Then he laid me down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was not disturbed during the night. Having given some further directions, and intimated that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.\n\n\u201cDo you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?\u201d asked Bessie, rather softly.\n\nScarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be rough. \u201cI will try.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like to drink, or could you eat anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank you, Bessie.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o\u2019clock; but you may call me if you want anything in the night.\u201d\n\nWonderful civility this! It emboldened me to ask a question.\n\n\u201cBessie, what is the matter with me? Am I ill?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you\u2019ll be better soon, no doubt.\u201d\n\nBessie went into the housemaid\u2019s apartment, which was near. I heard her say\u2014\n\n\u201cSarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren\u2019t for my life be alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it\u2019s such a strange thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything. Missis was rather too hard.\u201d\n\nSarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep. I caught scraps of their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer the main subject discussed.\n\n\u201cSomething passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished\u201d\u2014\u201cA great black dog behind him\u201d\u2014\u201cThree loud raps on the chamber door\u201d\u2014\u201cA light in the churchyard just over his grave,\u201d &c., &c.\n\nAt last both slept: the fire and the candle went out. For me, the watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; ear, eye, and mind were alike strained by dread: such dread as children only can feel.\n\nNo severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to this day. Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my bad propensities.\n\nNext day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by the nursery hearth. I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed. Yet, I thought, I ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama. Abbot, too, was sewing in another room, and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted kindness. This state of things should have been to me a paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.\n\nBessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise, nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privilege. This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it. Vain favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished for, too late! I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird, the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and tart away. Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word book acted as a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver\u2019s Travels from the library. This book I had again and again perused with delight. I considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves, having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker, and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in my creed, solid parts of the earth\u2019s surface, I doubted not that I might one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs, the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other. Yet, when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand\u2014when I turned over its leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now, never failed to find\u2014all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions. I closed the book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the untasted tart.\n\nBessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana\u2019s doll. Meantime she sang: her song was\u2014\n\n\u201cIn the days when we went gipsying,\n    A long time ago.\u201d\n\nI had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for Bessie had a sweet voice,\u2014at least, I thought so. But now, though her voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness. Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very lingeringly; \u201cA long time ago\u201d came out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn. She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful one.\n\n\u201cMy feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;\n    Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;\nSoon will the twilight close moonless and dreary\n    Over the path of the poor orphan child.\n\nWhy did they send me so far and so lonely,\n    Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?\nMen are hard-hearted, and kind angels only\n    Watch o\u2019er the steps of a poor orphan child.\n\nYet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,\n    Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,\nGod, in His mercy, protection is showing,\n    Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.\n\nEv\u2019n should I fall o\u2019er the broken bridge passing,\n    Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,\nStill will my Father, with promise and blessing,\n    Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.\n\nThere is a thought that for strength should avail me,\n    Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;\nHeaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;\n    God is a friend to the poor orphan child.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome, Miss Jane, don\u2019t cry,\u201d said Bessie as she finished. She might as well have said to the fire, \u201cdon\u2019t burn!\u201d but how could she divine the morbid suffering to which I was a prey? In the course of the morning Mr. Lloyd came again.\n\n\u201cWhat, already up!\u201d said he, as he entered the nursery. \u201cWell, nurse, how is she?\u201d\n\nBessie answered that I was doing very well.\n\n\u201cThen she ought to look more cheerful. Come here, Miss Jane: your name is Jane, is it not?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, Jane Eyre.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about? Have you any pain?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in the carriage,\u201d interposed Bessie.\n\n\u201cSurely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness.\u201d\n\nI thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I answered promptly, \u201cI never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate going out in the carriage. I cry because I am miserable.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh fie, Miss!\u201d said Bessie.\n\nThe good apothecary appeared a little puzzled. I was standing before him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey; not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face. Having considered me at leisure, he said\u2014\n\n\u201cWhat made you ill yesterday?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe had a fall,\u201d said Bessie, again putting in her word.\n\n\u201cFall! why, that is like a baby again! Can\u2019t she manage to walk at her age? She must be eight or nine years old.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was knocked down,\u201d was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by another pang of mortified pride; \u201cbut that did not make me ill,\u201d I added; while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.\n\nAs he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for the servants\u2019 dinner; he knew what it was. \u201cThat\u2019s for you, nurse,\u201d said he; \u201cyou can go down; I\u2019ll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back.\u201d\n\nBessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.\n\n\u201cThe fall did not make you ill; what did, then?\u201d pursued Mr. Lloyd when Bessie was gone.\n\n\u201cI was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark.\u201d\n\nI saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.\n\n\u201cGhost! What, you are a baby after all! You are afraid of ghosts?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf Mr. Reed\u2019s ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there. Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,\u2014so cruel that I think I shall never forget it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable? Are you afraid now in daylight?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo: but night will come again before long: and besides,\u2014I am unhappy,\u2014very unhappy, for other things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat other things? Can you tell me some of them?\u201d\n\nHow much I wished to reply fully to this question! How difficult it was to frame any answer! Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know not how to express the result of the process in words. Fearful, however, of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre, though, as far as it went, true response.\n\n\u201cFor one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a kind aunt and cousins.\u201d\n\nAgain I paused; then bunglingly enounced\u2014\n\n\u201cBut John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room.\u201d\n\nMr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?\u201d asked he. \u201cAre you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here than a servant.\u201d\n\n\u201cPooh! you can\u2019t be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you may\u2014who knows? Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think not, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone belonging to your father?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know: I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you had such, would you like to go to them?\u201d\n\nI reflected. Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes, scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty for me was synonymous with degradation.\n\n\u201cNo; I should not like to belong to poor people,\u201d was my reply.\n\n\u201cNot even if they were kind to you?\u201d\n\nI shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste.\n\n\u201cBut are your relatives so very poor? Are they working people?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly set: I should not like to go a begging.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like to go to school?\u201d\n\nAgain I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed\u2019s tastes were no rule for mine, and if Bessie\u2019s accounts of school-discipline (gathered from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought, equally attractive. She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened. Besides, school would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.\n\n\u201cI should indeed like to go to school,\u201d was the audible conclusion of my musings.\n\n\u201cWell, well! who knows what may happen?\u201d said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up. \u201cThe child ought to have change of air and scene,\u201d he added, speaking to himself; \u201cnerves not in a good state.\u201d\n\nBessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up the gravel-walk.\n\n\u201cIs that your mistress, nurse?\u201d asked Mr. Lloyd. \u201cI should like to speak to her before I go.\u201d\n\nBessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out. In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume, from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as they thought, asleep, \u201cMissis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand.\u201d Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.\n\nOn that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot\u2019s communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent: that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month of each other.\n\nBessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, \u201cPoor Miss Jane is to be pitied, too, Abbot.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d responded Abbot; \u201cif she were a nice, pretty child, one might compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a little toad as that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a great deal, to be sure,\u201d agreed Bessie: \u201cat any rate, a beauty like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!\u201d cried the fervent Abbot. \u201cLittle darling!\u2014with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour as she has; just as if she were painted!\u2014Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh rabbit for supper.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo could I\u2014with a roast onion. Come, we\u2019ll go down.\u201d They went.\nCHAPTER IV\n\nFrom my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,\u2014I desired and waited it in silence. It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the subject over which I brooded. Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room. Not a hint, however, did she drop about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion.\n\nEliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran from me uttering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose. I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama. I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how \u201cthat nasty Jane Eyre\u201d had flown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather harshly\u2014\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her.\u201d\n\nHere, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all deliberating on my words\u2014\n\n\u201cThey are not fit to associate with me.\u201d\n\nMrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day.\n\n\u201cWhat would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?\u201d was my scarcely voluntary demand. I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance: something spoke out of me over which I had no control.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or fiend. I was now in for it.\n\n\u201cMy Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you wish me dead.\u201d\n\nMrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour\u2019s length, in which she proved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof. I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging in my breast.\n\nNovember, December, and half of January passed away. Christmas and the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer; presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given. From every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed. When tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable. To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company, for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen. But Bessie, as soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper\u2019s room, generally bearing the candle along with her. I then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib. To this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it to be happy likewise.\n\nLong did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and listened for the sound of Bessie\u2019s step on the stairs: sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper\u2014a bun or a cheese-cake\u2014then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me, and said, \u201cGood night, Miss Jane.\u201d When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often wont to do. Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her nursery tales. She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and person are correct. I remember her as a slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at Gateshead Hall.\n\nIt was the fifteenth of January, about nine o\u2019clock in the morning: Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus obtained. She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her money, she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate of interest\u2014fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.\n\nGeorgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic. I was making my bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.). Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll\u2019s house furniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost.\n\nFrom this window were visible the porter\u2019s lodge and the carriage-road, and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll through. I watched it ascending the drive with indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted. All this being nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement. The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery.\n\n\u201cMiss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there? Have you washed your hands and face this morning?\u201d I gave another tug before I answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied\u2014\n\n\u201cNo, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.\u201d\n\n\u201cTroublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now? You look quite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the window for?\u201d\n\nI was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.\n\nI would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon me. I slowly descended. For nearly three months, I had never been called to Mrs. Reed\u2019s presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on which it dismayed me to intrude.\n\nI now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and I stopped, intimidated and trembling. What a miserable little poltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days! I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I must enter.\n\n\u201cWho could want me?\u201d I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts. \u201cWhat should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?\u2014a man or a woman?\u201d The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low, I looked up at\u2014a black pillar!\u2014such, at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital.\n\nMrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger with the words: \u201cThis is the little girl respecting whom I applied to you.\u201d\n\nHe, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice, \u201cHer size is small: what is her age?\u201d\n\n\u201cTen years.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo much?\u201d was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for some minutes. Presently he addressed me\u2014\u201cYour name, little girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cJane Eyre, sir.\u201d\n\nIn uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman; but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.\n\n\u201cWell, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?\u201d\n\nImpossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a contrary opinion: I was silent. Mrs. Reed answered for me by an expressive shake of the head, adding soon, \u201cPerhaps the less said on that subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;\u201d and bending from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite Mrs. Reed\u2019s. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said.\n\nI stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him. What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!\n\n\u201cNo sight so sad as that of a naughty child,\u201d he began, \u201cespecially a naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey go to hell,\u201d was my ready and orthodox answer.\n\n\u201cAnd what is hell? Can you tell me that?\u201d\n\n\u201cA pit full of fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat must you do to avoid it?\u201d\n\nI deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable: \u201cI must keep in good health, and not die.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you keep in good health? Children younger than you die daily. I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,\u2014a good little child, whose soul is now in heaven. It is to be feared the same could not be said of you were you to be called hence.\u201d\n\nNot being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far enough away.\n\n\u201cI hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress.\u201d\n\n\u201cBenefactress! benefactress!\u201d said I inwardly: \u201cthey all call Mrs. Reed my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you say your prayers night and morning?\u201d continued my interrogator.\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you read your Bible?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith pleasure? Are you fond of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job and Jonah.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Psalms? I hope you like them?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo? oh, shocking! I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: \u2018Oh! the verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;\u2019 says he, \u2018I wish to be a little angel here below;\u2019 he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant piety.\u201d\n\n\u201cPsalms are not interesting,\u201d I remarked.\n\n\u201cThat proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.\u201d\n\nI was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the conversation herself.\n\n\u201cMr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a tendency to deceit. I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst.\u201d\n\nWell might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above. Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst\u2019s eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?\n\n\u201cNothing, indeed,\u201d thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.\n\n\u201cDeceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,\u201d said Mr. Brocklehurst; \u201cit is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs. Reed. I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,\u201d continued my benefactress; \u201cto be made useful, to be kept humble: as for the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at Lowood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,\u201d returned Mr. Brocklehurst. \u201cHumility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them. I have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success. My second daughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she exclaimed: \u2018Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their frocks\u2014they are almost like poor people\u2019s children! and,\u2019 said she, \u2018they looked at my dress and mama\u2019s, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the state of things I quite approve,\u201d returned Mrs. Reed; \u201chad I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre. Consistency, my dear Mr. Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its inhabitants.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite right, sir. I may then depend upon this child being received as a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position and prospects?\u201d\n\n\u201cMadam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants, and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of her election.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too irksome.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning. I shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner. I shall send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there will be no difficulty about receiving her. Good-bye.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, madam. Little girl, here is a book entitled the \u2018Child\u2019s Guide\u2019; read it with prayer, especially that part containing \u2018An account of the awfully sudden death of Martha G\u2014\u2014, a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.\n\nMrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was sewing, I was watching her. Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was sound as a bell\u2014illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control; her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn; she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off handsome attire.\n\nSitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her figure; I perused her features. In my hand I held the tract containing the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning. What had just passed; what Mrs. Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment fomented now within me.\n\nMrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements.\n\n\u201cGo out of the room; return to the nursery,\u201d was her mandate. My look or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation. I got up, I went to the door; I came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up to her.\n\nSpeak I must: I had been trodden on severely, and must turn: but how? What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist? I gathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence\u2014\n\n\u201cI am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I.\u201d\n\nMrs. Reed\u2019s hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice continued to dwell freezingly on mine.\n\n\u201cWhat more have you to say?\u201d she asked, rather in the tone in which a person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily used to a child.\n\nThat eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had. Shaking from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued\u2014\n\n\u201cI am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth. You think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity. I shall remember how you thrust me back\u2014roughly and violently thrust me back\u2014into the red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, \u2018Have mercy! Have mercy, Aunt Reed!\u2019 And that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck me\u2014knocked me down for nothing. I will tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale. People think you a good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted. You are deceitful!\u201d\nHow dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth\n\nEre I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It seemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-for liberty. Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she would cry.\n\n\u201cJane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you? Why do you tremble so violently? Would you like to drink some water?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Mrs. Reed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there anything else you wish for, Jane? I assure you, I desire to be your friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful disposition; and I\u2019ll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what you have done.\u201d\n\n\u201cJane, you don\u2019t understand these things: children must be corrected for their faults.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeceit is not my fault!\u201d I cried out in a savage, high voice.\n\n\u201cBut you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the nursery\u2014there\u2019s a dear\u2014and lie down a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs. Reed, for I hate to live here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will indeed send her to school soon,\u201d murmured Mrs. Reed sotto voce; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.\n\nI was left there alone\u2014winner of the field. It was the hardest battle I had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror\u2019s solitude. First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses. A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction. A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour\u2019s silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating position.\n\nSomething of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned. Willingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed\u2019s pardon; but I knew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse of my nature.\n\nI would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre indignation. I took a book\u2014some Arabian tales; I sat down and endeavoured to read. I could make no sense of the subject; my own thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found fascinating. I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or breeze, through the grounds. I covered my head and arms with the skirt of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together. I leaned against a gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where the short grass was nipped and blanched. It was a very grey day; a most opaque sky, \u201conding on snaw,\u201d canopied all; thence flakes fell at intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without melting. I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and over again, \u201cWhat shall I do?\u2014what shall I do?\u201d\n\nAll at once I heard a clear voice call, \u201cMiss Jane! where are you? Come to lunch!\u201d\n\nIt was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step came tripping down the path.\n\n\u201cYou naughty little thing!\u201d she said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come when you are called?\u201d\n\nBessie\u2019s presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross. The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid\u2019s transitory anger; and I was disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart. I just put my two arms round her and said, \u201cCome, Bessie! don\u2019t scold.\u201d\n\nThe action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to indulge in: somehow it pleased her.\n\n\u201cYou are a strange child, Miss Jane,\u201d she said, as she looked down at me; \u201ca little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I suppose?\u201d\n\nI nodded.\n\n\u201cAnd won\u2019t you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does Bessie care for me? She is always scolding me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re such a queer, frightened, shy little thing. You should be bolder.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! to get more knocks?\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense! But you are rather put upon, that\u2019s certain. My mother said, when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one of her own to be in your place.\u2014Now, come in, and I\u2019ve some good news for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you have, Bessie.\u201d\n\n\u201cChild! what do you mean? What sorrowful eyes you fix on me! Well, but Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this afternoon, and you shall have tea with me. I\u2019ll ask cook to bake you a little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I am soon to pack your trunk. Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don\u2019t be afraid of me. Don\u2019t start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it\u2019s so provoking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to dread.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you dread them they\u2019ll dislike you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you do, Bessie?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t show it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou little sharp thing! you\u2019ve got quite a new way of talking. What makes you so venturesome and hardy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I shall soon be away from you, and besides\u201d\u2014I was going to say something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.\n\n\u201cAnd so you\u2019re glad to leave me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I\u2019m rather sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust now! and rather! How coolly my little lady says it! I dare say now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn\u2019t give it me: you\u2019d say you\u2019d rather not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.\u201d Bessie stooped; we mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted. That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her sweetest songs. Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.\nCHAPTER V\n\nFive o\u2019clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January, when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly dressed. I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib. I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates at six A.M. Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast. Few children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I. Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery. As we passed Mrs. Reed\u2019s bedroom, she said, \u201cWill you go in and bid Missis good-bye?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you say, Miss?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to the wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was wrong, Miss Jane.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was quite right, Bessie. Your Missis has not been my friend: she has been my foe.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Miss Jane! don\u2019t say so!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-bye to Gateshead!\u201d cried I, as we passed through the hall and went out at the front door.\n\nThe moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw. Raw and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down the drive. There was a light in the porter\u2019s lodge: when we reached it, we found the porter\u2019s wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door. It wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.\n\n\u201cIs she going by herself?\u201d asked the porter\u2019s wife.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how far is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty miles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a long way! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far alone.\u201d\n\nThe coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie\u2019s neck, to which I clung with kisses.\n\n\u201cBe sure and take good care of her,\u201d cried she to the guard, as he lifted me into the inside.\n\n\u201cAy, ay!\u201d was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed \u201cAll right,\u201d and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and mysterious regions.\n\nI remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road. We passed through several towns, and in one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the passengers alighted to dine. I was carried into an inn, where the guard wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled with musical instruments. Here I walked about for a long time, feeling very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having frequently figured in Bessie\u2019s fireside chronicles. At last the guard returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the \u201cstony street\u201d of L\u2014\u2014.\n\nThe afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley, dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.\n\nLulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open, and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress by the light of the lamps.\n\n\u201cIs there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?\u201d she asked. I answered \u201cYes,\u201d and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach instantly drove away.\n\nI was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion of the coach: gathering my faculties, I looked about me. Rain, wind, and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she shut and locked it behind her. There was now visible a house or houses\u2014for the building spread far\u2014with many windows, and lights burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room with a fire, where she left me alone.\n\nI stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough. I was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.\n\nThe first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was grave, her bearing erect.\n\n\u201cThe child is very young to be sent alone,\u201d said she, putting her candle down on the table. She considered me attentively for a minute or two, then further added\u2014\n\n\u201cShe had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?\u201d she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.\n\n\u201cA little, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to bed, Miss Miller. Is this the first time you have left your parents to come to school, my little girl?\u201d\n\nI explained to her that I had no parents. She inquired how long they had been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her forefinger, and saying, \u201cShe hoped I should be a good child,\u201d dismissed me along with Miss Miller.\n\nThe lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look, and air. Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards found she really was, an under-teacher. Led by her, I passed from compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room, with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of every age, from nine or ten to twenty. Seen by the dim light of the dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores. It was the hour of study; they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow\u2019s task, and the hum I had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.\n\nMiss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up to the top of the long room she cried out\u2014\n\n\u201cMonitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!\u201d\n\nFour tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered the books and removed them. Miss Miller again gave the word of command\u2014\n\n\u201cMonitors, fetch the supper-trays!\u201d\n\nThe tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray. The portions were handed round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common to all. When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating: I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.\n\nThe meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed off, two and two, upstairs. Overpowered by this time with weariness, I scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like the schoolroom, I saw it was very long. To-night I was to be Miss Miller\u2019s bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.\n\nThe night passed rapidly: I was too tired even to dream; I only once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my side. When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or two burned in the room. I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room. Again the bell rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out\u2014\n\n\u201cForm classes!\u201d\n\nA great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller repeatedly exclaimed, \u201cSilence!\u201d and \u201cOrder!\u201d When it subsided, I saw them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat. A pause of some seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.\n\nA distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each walked to a table and took her seat; Miss Miller assumed the fourth vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was called, and placed at the bottom of it.\n\nBusiness now began: the day\u2019s Collect was repeated, then certain texts of Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour. By the time that exercise was terminated, day had fully dawned. The indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting something to eat! I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so little the day before.\n\nThe refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth an odour far from inviting. I saw a universal manifestation of discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of the first class, rose the whispered words\u2014\n\n\u201cDisgusting! The porridge is burnt again!\u201d\n\n\u201cSilence!\u201d ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table, while a more buxom lady presided at the other. I looked in vain for her I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange, foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found, took the corresponding seat at the other board. A long grace was said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and the meal began.\n\nRavenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it. The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished. Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks being returned for what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of them, the stout one, whispered\u2014\n\n\u201cAbominable stuff! How shameful!\u201d\n\nA quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege. The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused roundly. Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had. Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures. I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general wrath; doubtless she shared in it.\n\nA clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and standing in the middle of the room, cried\u2014\n\n\u201cSilence! To your seats!\u201d\n\nDiscipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues. The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all seemed to wait. Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander\u2019s purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles. Above twenty of those clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.\n\nI was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the teachers\u2014none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten, and over-worked\u2014when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.\n\nWhat was the matter? I had heard no order given: I was puzzled. Ere I had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and encountered the personage who had received me last night. She stood at the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely. Miss Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her answer, went back to her place, and said aloud\u2014\n\n\u201cMonitor of the first class, fetch the globes!\u201d\n\nWhile the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly up the room. I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps. Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls, according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet; a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her girdle. Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple\u2014Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.\n\nThe superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history, grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls. The duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck twelve. The superintendent rose\u2014\n\n\u201cI have a word to address to the pupils,\u201d said she.\n\nThe tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it sank at her voice. She went on\u2014\n\n\u201cYou had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be hungry:\u2014I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to all.\u201d\n\nThe teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.\n\n\u201cIt is to be done on my responsibility,\u201d she added, in an explanatory tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.\n\nThe bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the high delight and refreshment of the whole school. The order was now given \u201cTo the garden!\u201d Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze. I was similarly equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.\n\nThe garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate, and each bed had an owner. When full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough.\n\nAs yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me; I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed; it did not oppress me much. I leant against a pillar of the verandah, drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within, delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking. My reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the future I could form no conjecture. I looked round the convent-like garden, and then up at the house\u2014a large building, half of which seemed grey and old, the other half quite new. The new part, containing the schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows, which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore this inscription:\u2014\n\nLOWOOD INSTITUTION.\n\nThis portion was rebuilt A.D. \u2014\u2014, by Naomi Brocklehurst,\nof Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.\n\n\u201cLet your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d\u2014St. Matt. v. 16.\n\nI read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import. I was still pondering the signification of \u201cInstitution,\u201d and endeavouring to make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture, when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head. I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the title\u2014it was \u201cRasselas;\u201d a name that struck me as strange, and consequently attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and I said to her directly\u2014\n\n\u201cIs your book interesting?\u201d I had already formed the intention of asking her to lend it to me some day.\n\n\u201cI like it,\u201d she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which she examined me.\n\n\u201cWhat is it about?\u201d I continued. I hardly know where I found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial.\n\n\u201cYou may look at it,\u201d replied the girl, offering me the book.\n\nI did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less taking than the title: \u201cRasselas\u201d looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed spread over the closely-printed pages. I returned it to her; she received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her\u2014\n\n\u201cCan you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means? What is Lowood Institution?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis house where you are come to live.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way different from other schools?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are charity-children. I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your father or your mother dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth died before I can remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this is called an institution for educating orphans.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we pay no money? Do they keep us for nothing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why do they call us charity-children?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the deficiency is supplied by subscription.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho subscribes?\u201d\n\n\u201cDifferent benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in London.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was Naomi Brocklehurst?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records, and whose son overlooks and directs everything here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he is treasurer and manager of the establishment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo Miss Temple? Oh, no! I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr. Brocklehurst for all she does. Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and all our clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he live here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014two miles off, at a large hall.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he a good man?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are the other teachers called?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work, and cuts out\u2014for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and teaches French.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like the teachers?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like the little black one, and the Madame \u2014\u2014?\u2014I cannot pronounce her name as you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Scatcherd is hasty\u2014you must take care not to offend her; Madame Pierrot is not a bad sort of person.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Miss Temple is the best\u2014isn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because she knows far more than they do.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you been long here?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo years.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you an orphan?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother is dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you happy here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ask rather too many questions. I have given you answers enough for the present: now I want to read.\u201d\n\nBut at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the house. The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong steam redolent of rancid fat. I found the mess to consist of indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together. Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every day\u2019s fare would be like this.\n\nAfter dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons recommenced, and were continued till five o\u2019clock.\n\nThe only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large schoolroom. The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious, especially for so great a girl\u2014she looked thirteen or upwards. I expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes. \u201cHow can she bear it so quietly\u2014so firmly?\u201d I asked of myself. \u201cWere I in her place, it seems to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up. She looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment\u2014beyond her situation: of something not round her nor before her. I have heard of day-dreams\u2014is she in a day-dream now? Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure they do not see it\u2014her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart: she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really present. I wonder what sort of a girl she is\u2014whether good or naughty.\u201d\n\nSoon after five P.M. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread. I devoured my bread and drank my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more\u2014I was still hungry. Half-an-hour\u2019s recreation succeeded, then study; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Such was my first day at Lowood.\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen. A change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind, whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.\n\nBefore the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I felt ready to perish with cold. Breakfast-time came at last, and this morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity small. How small my portion seemed! I wished it had been doubled.\n\nIn the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor therein. At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same. At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd\u2019s chair reading, and as all was quiet, the subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance. It was English history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops, she was suddenly sent to the very bottom. Even in that obscure position, Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:\u2014\n\n\u201cBurns\u201d (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), \u201cBurns, you are standing on the side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately.\u201d \u201cBurns, you poke your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in.\u201d \u201cBurns, I insist on your holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,\u201d &c. &c.\n\nA chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the girls examined. The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready with answers on every point. I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out\u2014\n\n\u201cYou dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this morning!\u201d\n\nBurns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d thought I, \u201cdoes she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face, as the water was frozen?\u201d\n\nMy attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark, stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd\u2019s movements. When I returned to my seat, that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to Burns\u2019 eye; and, while I paused from my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression.\n\n\u201cHardened girl!\u201d exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; \u201cnothing can correct you of your slatternly habits: carry the rod away.\u201d\n\nBurns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.\n\nThe play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five o\u2019clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning\u2014its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.\n\nOn the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside.\n\nProbably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise to clamour.\n\nJumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.\n\n\u201cIs it still \u2018Rasselas\u2019?\u201d I asked, coming behind her.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cand I have just finished it.\u201d\n\nAnd in five minutes more she shut it up. I was glad of this.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d thought I, \u201cI can perhaps get her to talk.\u201d I sat down by her on the floor.\n\n\u201cWhat is your name besides Burns?\u201d\n\n\u201cHelen.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you come a long way from here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you ever go back?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must wish to leave Lowood?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! why should I? I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it would be of no use going away until I have attained that object.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?\u201d\n"},{title:"The Adventures of Roderick Random",author:"T. Smollett",gender:"Male",text:" I was born in the northern part of this united kingdom, in the house of my grandfather, a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who had on many occasions signalised himself in behalf of his country; and was remarkable for his abilities in the law, which he exercised with great success in the station of a judge, particularly against beggars, for whom he had a singular aversion.\n\nMy father (his youngest son) falling in love with a poor relation, who lived with the old gentleman in quality of a housekeeper, espoused her privately; and I was the first fruit of that marriage. During her pregnancy, a dream discomposed my mother so much that her husband, tired with her importunity, at last consulted a highland seer, whose favourable interpretation he would have secured beforehand by a bribe, but found him incorruptible. She dreamed she was delivered of a tennis-ball, which the devil (who, to her great surprise, acted the part of a midwife) struck so forcibly with a racket that it disappeared in an instant; and she was for some time inconsolable for the lost of her offspring; when, all on a sudden, she beheld it return with equal violence, and enter the earth, beneath her feet, whence immediately sprang up a goodly tree covered with blossoms, the scent of which operated so strongly on her nerves that she awoke. The attentive sage, after some deliberation, assured my parents, that their firstborn would be a great traveller; that he would undergo many dangers and difficulties, and at last return to his native land, where he would flourish in happiness and reputation. How truly this was foretold will appear in the sequel. It was not long before some officious person informed my grandfather of certain familiarities that passed between his son and housekeeper which alarmed him so much that, a few days after, he told my father it was high time for him to think of settling; and that he had provided a match for him, to which he could in justice have no objections. My father, finding it would be impossible to conceal his situation much longer, frankly owned what he had done; and excused himself for not having asked the consent of his father, by saying, he knew it would have been to no purpose; and that, had his inclination been known, my grandfather might have taken such measures as would have effectually put the gratification of it out of his power: he added, that no exceptions could be taken to his wife\u2019s virtue, birth, beauty, and good sense, and as for fortune, it was beneath his care. The old gentleman, who kept all his passions, except one, in excellent order, heard him to an end with great temper, and then calmly asked, how he proposed to maintain himself and spouse? He replied, he could be in no danger of wanting while his father\u2019s tenderness remained, which he and his wife should always cultivate with the utmost veneration; and he was persuaded his allowance would be suitable to the dignity and circumstances of his family, and to the provision already made for his brothers and sisters, who were happily settled under his protection. \u201cYour brothers and sisters,\u201d said my grandfather, \u201cdid not think it beneath them to consult me in an affair of such importance as matrimony; neither, I suppose, would you have omitted that piece of duty, had you not some secret fund in reserve; to the comforts of which I leave you, with a desire that you will this night seek out another habitation for yourself and wife, whither, in a short time, I will send you an account of the expense I have been at in your education, with a view of being reimbursed. Sir, you have made the grand tour\u2014you are a polite gentleman\u2014a very pretty gentleman\u2014I wish you a great deal of joy, and am your very humble servant.\u201d\n\nSo saying, he left my father in a situation easily imagined. However, he did not long hesitate; for, being perfectly well acquainted with his father\u2019s disposition, he did not doubt that he was glad of this pretence to get rid of him; and his resolves being as invariable as the laws of the Medes and Persians, he knew it would be to no purpose to attempt him by prayers and entreaties; so without any farther application, he betook himself, with his disconsolate bedfellow to a farm-house, where an old servant of his mother dwelt: there they remained some time in a situation but ill adapted to the elegance of their desires and tenderness of their love; which nevertheless my father chose to endure, rather than supplicate an unnatural and inflexible parent but my mother, foreseeing the inconveniences to which she must have been exposed, had she been delivered in this place (and her pregnancy was very far advanced), without communicating her design to her husband, went in disguise to the house of my grandfather, hoping that her tears and condition would move him to compassion, and reconcile him to an event which was now irrecoverably past.\n\nShe found means to deceive the servants, and get introduced as an unfortunate lady, who wanted to complain of some matrimonial grievances, it being my grandfather\u2019s particular province to decide in all cases of scandal. She was accordingly admitted into his presence, where, discovering herself, she fell at his feet, and in the most affecting manner implored his forgiveness; at the same time representing the danger that threatened not only her life, but that of his own grandchild, which was about to see the light. He told her he was sorry that the indiscretion of her and his son had compelled him to make a vow, which put it out of his power to give them any assistance; that he had already imparted his thoughts on that subject to her husband, and was surprised that they should disturb his peace with any farther importunity. This said, he retired.\n\nThe violence of my mother\u2019s affliction had such an effect on her constitution that she was immediately seized with the pains of childbed; and had not an old maidservant, to whom she was very dear, afforded her pity and assistance, at the hazard of incurring my grandfather\u2019s displeasure, she and the innocent fruit of her womb must have fallen miserable victims to his rigour and inhumanity. By the friendship of this poor woman she was carried up to a garret, and immediately delivered of a man child, the story of whose unfortunate birth he himself now relates. My father, being informed of what had happened, flew to the embraces of his darling spouse, and while he loaded his offspring with paternal embraces, could not forbear shedding a flood of tears on beholding the dear partner of his heart (for whose ease he would have sacrificed the treasures of the east) stretched upon a flock bed, in a miserable apartment, unable to protect her from the inclemencies of the weather. It is not to be supposed that the old gentleman was ignorant of what passed, though he affected to know nothing of the matter, and pretended to be very much surprised, when one of his grandchildren, by his eldest son deceased, who lived with him as his heir apparent, acquainted him with the affair; he determined therefore to observe no medium, but immediately (on the third day after her delivery) sent her a peremptory order to be gone, and turned off the servant who had preserved her life. This behaviour so exasperated my father that he had recourse to the most dreadful imprecations; and on his bare knees implored that Heaven would renounce him if ever he should forget or forgive the barbarity of his sire.\n\nThe injuries which this unhappy mother received from her removal in such circumstances, and the want of necessaries where she lodged, together with her grief and anxiety of mind, soon threw her into a languishing disorder, which put an end to her life. My father, who loved her tenderly, was so affected with her death that he remained six weeks deprived of his senses; during which time, the people where he lodged carried the infant to the old man who relented so far, on hearing the melancholy story of his daughter-in-law\u2019s death, and the deplorable condition of his son, as to send the child to nurse, and he ordered my father to be carried home to his house, where he soon recovered the use of his reason.\n\nWhether this hardhearted judge felt any remorse for his cruel treatment of his son and daughter, or (which is more probable) was afraid his character would suffer in the neighbourhood, he professed great sorrow for his conduct to my father, whose delirium was succeeded by a profound melancholy and reserve. At length he disappeared, and, notwithstanding all imaginable inquiry, could not be heard of; a circumstance which confirmed most people in the opinion of his having made away with himself in a fit of despair. How I understood the particulars of my birth will appear in the course of these memoirs.\nCHAPTER II\n\nI grow up\u2014am hated by my Relations\u2014sent to School\u2014neglected by my Grandfather\u2014maltreated by my Master\u2014seasoned to Adversity\u2014I form Cabals against the Pedant\u2014am debarred Access to my Grandfather\u2014hunted by his Heir\u2014I demolish the Teeth of his Tutor\n\nThere were not wanting some who suspected my uncles of being concerned in my father\u2019s fate, on the supposition that they would all share in the patrimony destined for him; and this conjecture was strengthened by reflecting that in all his calamities they never discovered the least inclination to serve him; but, on the contrary, by all the artifices in their power, fed his resentment and supported his resolution of leaving him to misery and want. But people of judgment treated this insinuation as an idle chimera; because, had my relations been so wicked as to consult their interest by committing such an atrocious crime, the fate of my father would have extended to me too whose life was another obstacle to their expectation. Meanwhile, I grew apace, and as I strongly resembled my father, who was the darling of the tenants, I wanted nothing which their indigent circumstances could afford: but their favour was a weak resource against the jealous enmity of my cousins; who the more my infancy promised, conceived the more implacable hatred against me: and before I was six years of age, had so effectually blockaded my grandfather that I never saw him but by stealth, when I sometimes made up to his chair as he sat to view his labourers in the field: on which occasion he would stroke my head, bid me be a good boy, and promise to take care of me.\n\nI was soon after sent to school at a village hard by, of which he had been dictator time out of mind; but as he never paid for my board, nor supplied me with clothes, books, and other necessaries I required, my condition was very ragged and contemptible, and the schoolmaster, who, through fear of my grandfather, taught me gratis, gave himself no concern about the progress I made under his instruction. In spite of all these difficulties and disgraces, I became a good proficient in the Latin tongue; and, as soon as I could write tolerably, pestered my grandfather with letters to such a degree that he sent for my master, and chid him severely for bestowing such pains on my education, telling him that, if ever I should be brought to the gallows for forgery, which he had taught me to commit, my blood would lie on his head.\n\nThe pedant, who dreaded nothing more than the displeasure of his patron, assured his honour that the boy\u2019s ability was more owing to his own genius and application than to any instruction or encouragement he received; that, although he could not divest him of the knowledge he had already imbibed, unless he would empower him to disable his fingers, he should endeavour, with God\u2019s help, to prevent his future improvement. And, indeed, he punctually performed what he had undertaken; for, on pretence that I had written impertinent letters to my grandfather, he caused a board to be made with five holes in it, through which he thrust the fingers and thumb of my right hand, and fastened it by whipcord to my wrist, in such a manner as effectually debarred me the use of my pen. But this restraint I was freed from in a few days, by an accident which happened in a quarrel between me and another boy; who, taking upon him to insult my poverty, I was so incensed at his ungenerous reproach that with one stroke with my machine I cut him to the skull, to the great terror of myself and schoolfellows, who left him bleeding on the ground, and ran to inform the master of what had happened. I was so severely punished for this trespass that, were I to live to the age of Methusalem, the impression it made on me would not be effaced; the more than the antipathy and horror I conceived for the merciless tyrant who inflicted it. The contempt which my appearance naturally produced in all who saw me, the continual wants to which I was exposed, and my own haughty disposition, impatient of affronts, involved me in a thousand troublesome adventures, by which I was at length inured in adversity, and emboldened to undertakings far above my years. I was often inhumanly scourged for crimes I did not commit, because, having the character of a vagabond in the village, every piece of mischief, whose author lay unknown, was charged upon me. I have been found guilty of robbing orchards I never entered, of killing cats I never hunted, of stealing gingerbread I never touched, and of abusing old women I never saw. Nay, a stammering carpenter had eloquence enough to persuade my master that I fired a pistol loaded with small shot into his window; though my landlady and the whole family bore witness that I was abed fast asleep at the time when this outrage was committed. I was once flogged for having narrowly escaped drowning, by the sinking of a ferry boat in which I was passenger. Another time, for having recovered of a bruise occasioned by a horse and cart running over me. A third time, for being bitten by a baker\u2019s dog. In short, whether I was guilty or unfortunate, the correction and sympathy of this arbitrary pedagogue were the same.\n\nFar from being subdued by this informal usage, my indignation triumphed over that slavish awe which had hitherto enforced my obedience; and the more my years and knowledge increased, the more I perceived the injustice and barbarity of his behaviour. By the help of an uncommon genius, and the advice and direction of our usher, who had served my father in his travels, I made a surprising progress in the classics, writing, and arithmetic; so that, before I was twelve years old, I was allowed by everybody to be the best scholar in the school. This qualification, together with the boldness of temper and strength of make which had subjected almost all my contemporaries, gave me such influence over them that I began to form cabals against my persecutor; and was in hope of, being able to bid him defiance in a very short time. Being at the head of a faction, consisting of thirty boys, most of them of my own age, I was determined to put their mettle to trial, that I might know how far they were to be depended upon, before I put my grand scheme in execution: with this view, we attacked a body of stout apprentices, who had taken possession of a part of the ground allotted to us for the scheme of our diversions, and who were then playing at ninepins on the spot; but I had the mortification to see my adherents routed in an instant, and a leg of one of them broke in his flight by the bowl, which one of our adversaries had detached in pursuit of us. This discomfiture did not hinder us from engaging them afterwards in frequent skirmishes, which we maintained by throwing stones at a distance, wherein I received many wounds, the scars of which still remain. Our enemies were so harassed and interrupted by these alarms that they at last abandoned their conquest, and left us to the peaceable enjoyment of our own territories.\n\nIt would be endless to enumerate the exploits we performed in the course of this confederacy, which became the terror of the whole village; insomuch that, when different interests divided it, one of the parties commonly courted the assistance of Roderick Random (by which name I was known) to cast the balance, and keep the opposite faction in awe. Meanwhile, I took the advantage of every play-day to present myself before my grandfather, to whom I seldom found access, by reason of his being closely besieged by a numerous family of his female grandchildren, who, though they perpetually quarrelled among themselves, never failed to join against me, as the common enemy of all. His heir, who was about the age of eighteen, minded nothing but fox-hunting, and indeed was qualified for nothing else, notwithstanding his grandfather\u2019s indulgence in entertaining a tutor for him at home; who at the same time performed the office of parish clerk. This young Actaeon, who inherited his grandfather\u2019s antipathy to everything in distress, never sat eyes on me without uncoupling his beagles, and hunting me into some cottage or other, whither I generally fled for shelter. In this Christian amusement he was encouraged by his preceptor, who, no doubt, took such opportunities to ingratiate himself with the rising sun, observing, that the old gentleman, according to the course of nature, had not long to live, for he was already on the verge of fourscore.\n\nThe behaviour of this rascally sycophant incensed me so much, that one day, when I was beleaguered by him and his hounds in a farmer\u2019s house, where I had found protection, I took aim at him (being an excellent marksman) with a large pebble, which struck out four of his foreteeth, and effectually incapacitated him from doing the office of a clerk.\nCHAPTER III\n\nMy Mother\u2019s Brother arrives\u2014relieves me\u2014a Description of him\u2014he goes along with me to the House of my Grandfather\u2014is encountered by his Dogs\u2014defeats them, after a bloody Engagement\u2014is admitted to the old Gentleman\u2014a Dialogue between them\n\nAbout this time my mother\u2019s only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man-of-war, arrived in his own country; where being informed of my condition, he came to see me, and out of his slender finances not only supplied me with what necessaries I wanted for the present, but resolved not to leave the country until he had prevailed on my grandfather to settle something handsome for the future. This was a task to which he was by no means equal, being entirely ignorant, not only of the judge\u2019s disposition, but also of the ways of men in general, to which his education on board had kept him an utter stranger.\n\nHe was a strong built man, somewhat bandy legged, with a neck like that of a bull, and a face which (you might easily perceive) had withstood the most obstinate assaults of the weather. His dress consisted of a soldier\u2019s coat altered for him by the ship\u2019s tailor, a striped flannel jacket, a pair of red breeches spanned with pitch, clean gray worsted stockings, large silver buckles that covered three-fourths of his shoes, a silver-laced hat, whose crown overlooked the brims about an inch and a half, black bobwig in buckle, a check shirt, a silk handkerchief, a hanger, with a brass handle, girded to his thigh by a furnished lace belt, and a good oak plant under his arm. Thus equipped, he set out with me (who by his bounty made a very decent appearance) for my grandfather\u2019s house, where we were saluted by Jowler and Caesar, whom my cousin, young master, had let loose at our approach. Being well acquainted with the inveteracy of these curs, I was about to betake myself to my heels, when my uncle seized me with one hand, brandished his cudgel with the other, and at one blow laid Caesar sprawling on the ground; but, finding himself attacked at the same time in the rear by Jowler, and fearing Caesar might recover, he drew his hanger, wheeled about, and by a lucky stroke severed Jowler\u2019s head from his body. By this time, the young foxhunter and three servants, armed with pitchforks and flails, were come to the assistance of the dogs, whom they found breathless upon the field; and my cousin was so provoked at the death of his favourites, that he ordered his attendants to advance, and take vengeance on their executioner, whom he loaded with all the curses and reproaches his anger could suggest. Upon which my uncle stepped forwards with an undaunted air, at the sight of whose bloody weapons his antagonists fell back with precipitation, when he accosted their leader thus:\n\n\u201cLookee, brother, your dogs having boarded me without provocation, what I did was in my own defence. So you had best be civil, and let us shoot a head, clear of you.\u201d\n\nWhether the young squire misinterpreted my uncle\u2019s desire of peace, or was enraged at the fate of his hounds beyond his usual pitch of resolution, I know not; but he snatched a flail from one of his followers, and came up with a show of assaulting the lieutenant, who, putting himself in a posture of defence, proceeded thus: \u201cLookee, you lubberly son of a w\u2014e, if you come athwart me, \u2019ware your gingerbread work. I\u2019ll be foul of your quarter, d\u2014n me.\u201d\n\nThis declaration, followed by a flourish of his hanger, seemed to check the progress of the young gentleman\u2019s choler, who, looking behind him, perceived his attendants had slunk into the house, shut the gate, and left him to decide the contention by himself.\n\nHere a parley ensued, which was introduced by my cousin\u2019s asking, \u201cWho the devil are you? What do you want? Some scoundrel of a seaman, I suppose, who has deserted and turned thief. But don\u2019t think you shall escape, sirrah\u2014I\u2019ll have you hang\u2019d, you dog, I will. Your blood shall pay for that of my two hounds, you ragamuffin. I would not have parted with them to save your whole generation from the gallows, you ruffian, you!\u201d \u201cNone of your jaw, you swab\u2014none of your jaw,\u201d replied my uncle, \u201celse I shall trim your laced jacket for you. I shall rub you down with an oaken towel, my boy, I shall.\u201d So saying, he sheathed his hanger, and grasped his cudgel. Meanwhile the people of the house being alarmed, one of my female cousins opened a window, and asked what was the matter. \u201cThe matter!\u201d answered the lieutenant; \u201cno great matter, young woman; I have business with the old gentleman, and this spark, belike, won\u2019t allow me to come alongside of him,\u201d that\u2019s all. After a few minutes pause we were admitted, and conducted to my grandfather\u2019s chamber through a lane of my relations, who honoured me with very significant looks as I passed along. When we came into the judge\u2019s presence my uncle, after two or three sea-bows, expressed himself in this manner; \u201cYour servant, your servant. What cheer, father? what cheer? I suppose you don\u2019t know me\u2014mayhap you don\u2019t. My name is Tom Bowling, and this here boy, you look as if you did not know him neither; \u2019tis like you mayn\u2019t. He\u2019s new rigged, i\u2019faith; his cloth don\u2019t shake in the wind so much as it wont to do. \u2019Tis my nephew, d\u2019y see, Roderick Random\u2014your own flesh and blood, old gentleman. Don\u2019t lay a-stern, you dog,\u201d pulling me forward. My grandfather (who was laid up with the gout) received this relation, after his long absence, with that coldness of civility which was peculiar to him; told him he was glad to see him, and desired him to sit down. \u201cThank ye, thank ye, sir, I had as lief stand,\u201d said my uncle; \u201cfor my own part, I desire nothing of you; but, if you have any conscience at all, do something for this poor boy, who has been used at a very unchristian rate. Unchristian do I call it? I am sure the Moors in Barbary have more humanity than to leave their little ones to want. I would fain know why my sister\u2019s son is more neglected than that there fair-weather Jack\u201d (pointing to the young squire, who with the rest of my cousins had followed us into the room). \u201cIs not he as near akin to you as the other? Is he not much handsomer and better built than that great chucklehead? Come, come, consider, old gentleman, you are going in a short time to give an account of your evil actions. Remember the wrongs you did his father, and make all the satisfaction in your power before it be too late. The least thing you can do is to settle his father\u2019s portion on him.\u201d\n\nThe young ladies, who thought themselves too much concerned to contain themselves any longer, set up their throats all together against my protector\u2014\u201cScurvy companion\u2014saucy tarpaulin\u2014rude, impertinent fellow, did he think to prescribe to grandpapa? His sister\u2019s brat had been too well taken care of. Grandpapa was too just not make a difference between an unnatural, rebellious son and his dutiful, loving children, who took his advice in all things;\u201d and such expressions were vented against him with great violence; until the judge at length commanded silence. He calmly rebuked my uncle for his unmannerly behaviour, which he said he would excuse on account of his education: he told him he had been very kind to the boy, whom he had kept at school seven or eight years, although he was informed he made no progress in his learning but was addicted to all manner of vice, which he rather believed, because he himself was witness to a barbarous piece of mischief he had committed on the jaws of his chaplain. But, however, he would see what the lad was fit for, and bind him apprentice to some honest tradesman or other, provided he would mend his manners, and behave for the future as became him.\n\nThe honest tar (whose pride and indignation boiled within him) answered my grandfather, that it was true he had sent him to school, but it had cost him nothing, for he had never been at one shilling expense to furnish him with food, raiment, books, or other necessaries; so that it was not much to be wondered at, if the boy made small progress; and yet whoever told him so was a lying, lubberly rascal, and deserved to be keel-haul\u2019d; for though he (the lieutenant) did not understand those matters himself, he was well informed as how Rory was the best scholar of his age in all the country; the truth of which he would maintain, by laying a wager of his whole half-year\u2019s pay on the boy\u2019s head\u2014with these words he pulled out his purse, and challenged the company: \u201cNeither is he predicted to vice, as you affirm, but rather, left like a wreck, d\u2019ye see, at the mercy of the wind and weather, by your neglect, old gentleman. As for what happened to your chaplain, I am only sorry that he did not knock out the scoundrel\u2019s brains instead of his teeth. By the Lord, if ever I come up with him, he had better be in Greenland, that\u2019s all. Thank you for your courteous offer of binding the lad apprentice to a tradesman. I suppose you would make a tailor of him\u2014would you? I had rather see him hang\u2019d, d\u2019ye see. Come along, Rory, I perceive how the land lies, my boy\u2014let\u2019s tack about, i\u2019faith\u2014while I have a shilling you shan\u2019t want a tester. B\u2019we, old gentleman; you\u2019re bound for the other world, but I believe damnably ill-provided for the voyage.\u201d Thus ended our visit; and we returned to the village, my uncle muttering curses all the way against the old shark and the young fry that surrounded him.\nCHAPTER IV\n\nMy Grandfather makes his Will\u2014our second Visit\u2014he Dies\u2014his Will is read in Presence of all his living Descendants\u2014the Disappointment of my female Cousins\u2014my Uncle\u2019s Behaviour\n\nA few weeks after our first visit, we were informed that the old judge, at the end of a fit of thoughtfulness, which lasted three days, had sent for a notary and made his will; that the distemper had mounted from his legs to his stomach, and, being conscious of his approaching end, he had desired to see all his descendants without exception. In obedience to this summons, my uncle set out with me a second time, to receive the last benediction of my grandfather: often repeating by the road, \u201cEy, ey, we have brought up the old hulk at last. You shall see\u2014you shall see the effect of my admonition,\u201d When we entered his chamber, which was crowded with his relations, we advanced to the bedside, where we found him in his last agonies, supported by two of his granddaughters, who sat on each side of him, sobbing most piteously, and wiping away the froth and slaver as it gathered on his lips, which they frequently kissed with a show of great anguish and affection. My uncle approached him with these words, \u201cWhat! he\u2019s not a-weigh. How fare ye? how fare ye, old gentleman? Lord have mercy upon your poor sinful soul!\u201d Upon which, the dying man turned his languid eyes towards us, and Mr. Bowling went on\u2014\u201cHere\u2019s poor Roy come to see you before you die, and to receive your blessing. What, man! don\u2019t despair, you have been a great sinner, \u2019tis true,\u2014what then? There\u2019s a righteous judge above, an\u2019t there? He minds me no more than a porpoise. Yes, yes, he\u2019s a-going; the land crabs will have him, I see that! his anchor\u2019s a-peak, i\u2019faith.\u201d This homely consolation scandalised the company so much, and especially the parson, who probably thought his province invaded, that we were obliged to retire into another room, where, in a few minutes, we were convinced of my grandfather\u2019s decease, by a dismal yell uttered by the young ladies in his apartment; whither we immediately hastened, and found his heir, who had retired a little before into a closet, under pretence of giving vent to his sorrow, asking, with a countenance beslubbered with tears, if his grandpapa was certainly dead? \u201cDead!\u201d (says my uncle, looking, at the body) \u201cay, ay, I\u2019ll warrant him as dead as a herring. Odd\u2019s fish! now my dream is out for all the world. I thought I stood upon the forecastle, and saw a parcel of carrion crows foul of a dead shark: that floated alongside, and the devil perching upon our spritsail yard, in the likeness of a blue bear\u2014who, d\u2019ye see jumped overboard upon the carcass and carried it to the bottom in his claws.\u201d \u201cOut upon thee, reprobate\u201d cries the parson \u201cout upon thee, blasphemous wretch! Dost thou think his honour\u2019s soul is in the possession of Satan?\u201d The clamour immediately arose, and my poor uncle, being, shouldered from one corner of the room to the other, was obliged to lug out in his own defence, and swear he would turn out for no man, till such time as he knew who had the title to send him adrift. \u201cNone of your tricks upon travellers,\u201d said he; \u201cmayhap old Bluff has left my kinsman here his heir: if he has, it will be the better for his miserable soul. Odds bob! I\u2019d desire no better news. I\u2019d soon make him a clear shin, I warrant you.\u201d To avoid any further disturbance, one of my grandfather\u2019s executors, who was present, assured Mr. Bowling, that his nephew should have all manner of justice; that a day should be appointed after the funeral for examining the papers of the deceased, in presence of all his relations; till which time every desk and cabinet in the house should remain close sealed; and that he was very welcome to be witness to this ceremony, which was immediately performed to his satisfaction. In the meantime, orders were given to provide mourning for all the relations, in which number I was included; but my uncle would not suffer me to accept of it, until I should be assured whether or no I had reason to honour his memory so far. During this interval, the conjectures of people, with regard to the old gentleman\u2019s will, were various: as it was well known, he had, besides his landed estate, which was worth \xa3700 per annum, six or seven thousand pounds at interest, some imagined that the whole real estate (which he had greatly improved) would go to the young man whom he always entertained as his heir; and that the money would be equally divided between my female cousins (five in number) and me. Others were of opinion, that, as the rest of the children had been already provided for, he would only bequeath two or three hundred pounds to each of his granddaughters, and leave the bulk of the sum to me, to atone for his unnatural usage of my father. At length the important hour arrived, and the will was produced in the midst of the expectants, whose looks and gestures formed a group that would have been very entertaining to an unconcerned spectator. But, the reader can scarce conceive the astonishment and mortification that appeared, when an attorney pronounced aloud, the young squire sole heir of all his grandfather\u2019s estate, personal and real. My uncle, who had listened with great attention, sucking the head of his cudgel all the while, accompanied these words of the attorney with a stare, and whew, that alarmed the whole assembly. The eldest and pertest of my female competitors, who had been always very officious about my grandfather\u2019s person, inquired, with a faltering accent and visage as yellow as an orange, \u201cif there were no legacies?\u201d and was answered, \u201cNone at all.\u201d Upon which she fainted away. The rest, whose expectations, perhaps, were not so sanguine, supported their disappointment with more resolution, though not without giving evident marks of indignation, and grief at least as genuine as that which appeared in them at the old gentleman\u2019s death. My conductor, after having kicked with his heel for some time against the wainscot, began: \u201cSo there\u2019s no legacy, friend, ha!\u2014here\u2019s an old succubus; but somebody\u2019s soul howls for it, d\u2014n me!\u201d The parson of the parish, who was one of the executors, and had acted as ghostly director to the old man, no sooner heard this exclamation than he cried out, \u201cAvaunt, unchristian reviler! avaunt! wilt thou not allow the soul of his honour to rest in peace?\u201d But this zealous pastor did not find himself so warmly seconded, as formerly, by the young ladies, who now joined my uncle against him, and accused him of having acted the part of a busybody with their grandpapa whose ears he had certainly abused by false stories to their prejudice, or else he would not have neglected them in such an unnatural manner. The young squire was much diverted with this scene, and whispered to my uncle, that if he had not murdered his dogs, he would have shown him glorious fun, by hunting a black badger (so he termed the clergyman). The surly lieutenant, who was not in a humour to relish this amusement, replied, \u201cYou and your dogs may be damn\u2019d. I suppose you\u2019ll find them with your old dad, in the latitude of hell. Come, Rory,\u2014about ship, my lad, we must steer another course, I think.\u201d And away we went.\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe Schoolmaster uses me barbarously\u2014I form a Project of Revenge, in which I am assisted by my Uncle\u2014I leave the Village\u2014am settled at a University by his Generosity\n\nOn our way back to the village, my uncle spoke not a word during the space of a whole hour, but whistled with great vehemence the tune of \u201cWhy should we quarrel for riches,\u201d etc. his visage being contracted all the while into a most formidable frown. At length his pace increased to such a degree that I was left behind a considerable way: then he waited for me; and when I was almost up with him, called out in a surly tone, \u201cBear a hand, damme! must I bring to every minute for you, you lazy dog.\u201d Then, laying hold of me by the arm, hauled me along, until his good nature (of which he had a great share) and reflection getting the better of his he said, \u201cCome, my boy, don\u2019t be cast down,\u2014the old rascal is in hell, that\u2019s some satisfaction; you shall go to sea with me, my lad. A light heart and a thin pair of breeches goes through the world, brave boys, as the song goes\u2014eh!\u201d Though this proposal did not at all suit my inclination, I was afraid of discovering my aversion to it, lest I should disoblige the only friend I had in the world; and he was so much a seaman that he never dreamt I could have had any objection to his design; consequently gave himself no trouble in consulting my approbation. But this resolution was soon dropped, by the device of our usher, who assured Mr. Bowling, it would be a thousand pities to balk my genius, which would certainly one day make my fortune on shore, provided it received due cultivation. Upon which, this generous tar determined (though he could ill afford it) to give me university education; and accordingly settled my board and other expenses, at a town not many miles distant, famous for its colleges, whither we repaired in a short time. But, before the day of our departure, the schoolmaster, who no longer had the fear of my grandfather before his eyes, laid aside all decency and restraint, and not only abused me in the grossest language his rancour could suggest, as a wicked, profligate, dull, beggarly miscreant, whom he had taught out of charity; but also inveighed in the most bitter manner against the memory of the judge (who by the by had procured that settlement for him), hinting, in pretty plain terms, that the old gentleman\u2019s soul was damned to all eternity for his injustice in neglecting to pay for my learning.\n\nThis brutal behaviour, added to the sufferings I had formerly undergone made me think it high time to be revenged on this insolent pedagogue. Having consulted my adherents, I found them all staunch in their promises to stand by me; and our scheme was this:\u2014In the afternoon preceding to the day of our departure for the University, I resolved to take the advantage of the usher\u2019s going out to make water (which he regularly did at four o\u2019clock), and shut the great door, that he might not come to the assistance of his superior. This being done, the assault was to be begun by my advancing to my master and spitting in his face. I was to be seconded by two of the strongest boys in the school, who were devoted to me; their business was to join me in dragging the tyrant to a bench, over which he was to be laid, and his bare posteriors heartily flogged, with his own birch, which we proposed to wrest from him in his struggle; but if we should find him too many for us all three, we were to demand the assistance of our competitors, who should be ready to enforce us, or oppose anything that might be undertaken for the master\u2019s relief. One of my principal assistants was called Jeremy Gawky, son and heir of a wealthy gentleman in the neighbourhood; and the name of the other, Hugh Strap, the cadet of a family which had given shoemakers to the village time out of mind. I had once saved Gawky\u2019s life, by plunging into a river and dragging him on shore, when he was on the point of being drowned. I had often rescued him from the clutches of those whom his insufferable arrogance had provoked to a resentment he was not able to sustain; and many times saved his reputation and posteriors, by performing his exercises at school; so that it is not to be wondered at, if he had a particular regard for me and my interests. The attachment of Strap flowed from a voluntary, disinterested inclination, which had manifested itself on many occasions in my behalf, he having once rendered me the same service that I had rendered Gawky, by saving my life at the risk of his own; and often fathered offences that I had committed, for which he suffered severely, rather than I should feel the weight of the punishment. These two champions were the more willing to engage in this enterprise, because they intended to leave the school next day, as well as I; the first being ordered by his father to return into the country, and the other being bound apprentice to his barber, at a market town not far off.\n\nIn the meantime, my uncle, being informed of my master\u2019s behaviour to me, was enraged at his insolence, and vowed revenge so heartily that I could not refrain from telling him the scheme I had concerted, while he heard with great satisfaction, at every sentence squirting out a mouthful of spittle, tinctured with tobacco, of which he constantly chewed a large quid. At last, pulling up his breeches, he cried, \u201cNo, no, z\u2014ds! that won\u2019t do neither; howsoever, \u2019tis a bold undertaking, my lad, that I must say, i\u2019faith; but lookee, lookee, how do you propose to get clear off\u2014won\u2019t the enemy give chase, my boy?\u2014ay, ay, that he will, I warrant, and alarm the whole coast; ah! God help thee, more sail than ballast, Rory. Let me alone for that\u2014leave the whole to me. I\u2019ll show him the foretopsail, I will. If so be your shipmates are jolly boys, and won\u2019t flinch, you shall see, you shall see; egad, I\u2019ll play him such a salt-water trick I\u2019ll bring him to the gangway and anoint him with a cat-and-nine-tails; he shall have a round dozen doubled, my lad, he shall\u2014and be left lashed to his meditations.\u201d We were very proud of our associate, who immediately went to work, and prepared the instrument of his revenge with great skill and expedition; after which, he ordered our baggage to be packed up and sent off, a day before our attempt, and got horses ready to be mounted, as soon as the affair should be over. At length the hour arrived, when our auxiliary, seizing the opportunity of the usher\u2019s absence, bolted in, secured the door, and immediately laid hold of the pedant by his collar who bawled out, \u201cMurder, Thieves,\u201d with the voice of a Stentor. Though I trembled all over like an aspen leaf, I knew there was no time to be lost, and accordingly got up, and summoned our associates to our assistance. Strap, without any hesitation, obeyed the signal, and seeing me leap upon the master\u2019s back, ran immediately to one of his legs, which pulling with all his force, this dreadful adversary was humbled to the ground; upon which Gawky, who had hitherto remained in his place, under the influence of a universal trepidation, hastened to the scene of action, and insulted the fallen tyrant with a loud huzza, in which the whole school joined. The noise alarmed the usher, who, finding himself shut out, endeavoured, partly by threats and partly by entreaties, to procure admission. My uncle bade him have a little patience, and he would let him in presently; but if he pretended to stir from that place, it should fare the worse with the son of a bitch his superior, on whom he intended only to bestow a little wholesome chastisement, for his barbarous usage of Rory, \u201cto which,\u201d said he, \u201cyou are no stranger.\u201d By this time we had dragged the criminal to a post, to which Bowling tied him with a rope he had provided on purpose; after having secured his hands and stripped his back. In this ludicrous posture he stood (to the no small entertainment of the boys, who crowded about him, and shouted with great exultation at the novelty of the sight), venting bitter imprecations against the lieutenant, and reproaching his scholars with treachery and rebellion; when the usher was admitted, whom my uncle accosted in this manner: \u201cHarkee, Mr. Syntax, I believe you are an honest man, d\u2019ye see\u2014and I have a respect for you\u2014but for all that, we must, for our own security, d\u2019ye see, belay you for a short time.\u201d With these words, he pulled out some fathoms of cord, which the honest man no sooner saw than he protested with great earnestness he would allow no violence to be offered to him, at the same time accusing me of perfidy and ingratitude. But Bowling representing that it was in vain to resist, and that he did not mean to use him with violence and indecency, but only to hinder him from raising the hue and cry against us before we should be out of their power, he allowed himself to be bound to his own desk, where he sat a spectator of the punishment inflicted on his principal. My uncle, having upbraided this arbitrary wretch with his inhumanity to me, told him, that he proposed to give him a little discipline for the good of his soul, which he immediately put in practice, with great vigour and dexterity. This smart application to the pedant\u2019s withered posteriors gave him such exquisite pain that he roared like a mad bull, danced, cursed, and blasphemed, like a frantic bedlamite. When the lieutenant thought himself sufficiently revenged, he took his leave of him in these words: \u201cNow, friend, you\u2019ll remember me the longest day you have to live; I have given you a lesson that will let you know what flogging is, and teach you to have more sympathy for the future. Shout, boys, shout!\u201d\n\nThis ceremony was no sooner over than my uncle proposed they should quit the school, and convey their old comrade Rory to the public-house, about a mile from the village, where he would treat them all. His offer being joyfully embraced, he addressed himself to Mr. Syntax, and begged him to accompany us; but this invitation he refused with great disdain, telling my benefactor he was not the man he took him to be. \u201cWell, well, old surly,\u201d replied my uncle, shaking his hand, \u201cthou art an honest fellow notwithstanding; and if ever I have the command of a ship, thou shalt be our schoolmaster, i\u2019faith.\u201d So saying he dismissed the boys, and locking the door, left the two preceptors to console one another; while we moved forwards on our journey, attended by a numerous retinue, whom he treated according to his promise.\n\nWe parted with many tears, and lay that night at an inn on the road, about ten miles short of the town where I was to remain, at which we arrived next day, and I found I had no cause to complain of the accommodations provided for me, in being boarded at the house of an apothecary, who had married a distant relation of my mother. In a few days after, my uncle set out for his ship, having settled the necessary funds for my maintenance and education.\nCHAPTER VI\n\nI make great progress in my Studies\u2014am caressed by Everybody\u2014my female Cousins take notice of me\u2014I reject their Invitation\u2014they are incensed, and conspire against me\u2014am left destitute by a Misfortune that befalls my Uncle\u2014Gawky\u2019s Treachery\u2014my Revenge\n\nAs I was now capable of reflection, I began to consider my precarious situation; that I was utterly abandoned by those whose duty it was to protect me: and that my sole dependence was on the generosity of one man, who was not only exposed by his profession to continual dangers, which might one day deprive me of him for ever; but also (no doubt) subject to those vicissitudes of disposition which a change of fortune usually creates, or which a better acquaintance with the world might produce; for I always ascribed his benevolence to the dictates of a heart as yet undebauched by a commerce with mankind. Alarmed at these considerations, I resolved to apply myself with great care to my studies, and enjoy the opportunity in my power: this I did with such success that, in the space of three years, I understood Greek very well, was pretty far advanced in the mathematics, and no stranger to moral and natural philosophy: logic I made no account of; but, above all things, I valued myself on my taste in the belles lettres, and a talent for poetry, which had already produced some pieces that had met with a favourable reception. These qualifications, added to a good face and shape, acquired the esteem and acquaintance of the most considerable people in town, and I had the satisfaction to find myself in some degree of favour with the ladies; an intoxicating piece of good fortune to one of my amorous complexion! which I obtained, or at least preserved, by gratifying their propensity to scandal, in lampooning their rivals.\n\nTwo of my female cousins lived in this place, with their mother, since the death of their father, who left his whole fortune equally divided between them; so that, if they were not the most beautiful, they were at least the richest toasts in town; and received daily the addresses of all the beaux and cavaliers of the country. Although I had hitherto been looked upon by them with the most supercilious contempt, my character now attracted their notice so much that I was given to understand I might be honoured with their acquaintance, if I pleased.\n\nThe reader will easily perceive that this condescension either flowed from the hope of making my poetical capacity subservient to their malice, or at least of screening themselves from the lash of my resentment, which they had effectually provoked. I enjoyed this triumph with great satisfaction, and not only rejected their offer with disdain, but in all my performances, whether satire or panegyric, industriously avoided mentioning their names, even while I celebrated those of their intimates: this neglect mortified their pride exceedingly and incensed them to such a degree that they were resolved to make me repent of my indifference. The first stroke of their revenge consisted in their hiring a poor collegian to write verses against me, the subject of which was my own poverty, and the catastrophe of my unhappy parents; but, besides the badness of the composition (of which they themselves were ashamed), they did not find their account in endeavouring to reproach me with those misfortunes which they and their relations had brought upon me; and which consequently reflected much more dishonour on themselves than on me, who was the innocent victim of their barbarity and avarice.\n\nFinding this plan miscarry, they found means to irritate a young gentleman against me, by telling him I had lampooned his mistress; and so effectually succeeded in the quality of incendiaries that this enraged lover determined to seize me next night as I returned to my lodgings from a friend\u2019s house that I frequented: with this view, he waited in the street, attended by two of his companions, to whom he had imparted his design of carrying me down to the river, in which proposed to have me heartily ducked, notwithstanding the severity of the weather, it being then about the middle of December. But this stratagem did not succeed; for, being apprised of their ambush, I got home another way, and by the help of my landlord\u2019s apprentice, discharged a volley from the garret window, which did great execution upon them, and next day occasioned so much mirth at their expense that they found themselves under a necessity of leaving the town, until the adventure should be entirely forgotten.\n\nMy cousins (though twice baffled in their expectation) did not, however, desist from persecuting me, who had now enraged them beyond a possibility of forgiveness by detecting their malice and preventing its effects: neither should I have found them more humane, had I patiently submitted to their rancour, and borne without murmuring the rigour of their unreasonable hate; for I have found by experience, that though small favours may be acknowledged and slight injuries atoned, there is no wretch so ungrateful as he whom you have most generously obliged, and no enemy so implacable as those who have done you the greatest wrong. These good-natured creatures, therefore, had recourse to a scheme which conspired with a piece of bad news I soon after received, to give them all the satisfaction they desired: this plan was to debauch the faith of my companion and confidant, who betrayed the trust I reposed in him, by imparting to them the particulars of my small amours, which they published with such exaggerations that I suffered very much in the opinion of everybody, and was utterly discarded by the dear creatures whose names had been called in question.\n\nWhile I was busy in tracing out the author of this treachery, that I might not only be revenged on him, but also vindicate my character to my friends, I one day perceived the looks of my landlady much altered, when I went home to my dinner, and inquiring into the cause, she screwed up her mouth, and fixed her eyes on the ground, told me her husband had received a letter from Mr. Bowling, with one inclosed for me. She was very sorry for what had happened, both for my sake and his own\u2014people should be more cautious of their conduct\u2014she was always afraid his brutal behaviour would bring him into some misfortune or other. As for her part, she should be very ready to befriend me; but she had a small family of her own to maintain. The world would do nothing for her if she should come to want\u2014charity begins at home: she wished I had been bound to some substantial handicraft, such as a weaver or a shoemaker, rather than loiter away my time in learning foolish nonsense, that would never bring me in a penny but some folks are wise, and some are otherwise.\n\nI was listening to this mysterious discourse with great amazement, when her husband entered, and, without speaking a syllable, put both the letters into my hand. I received them trembling, and read what follows:\n\n\u2018To Mr. Roger Potion\n    \u2018Sir,\n    \u2018This is to let you know that I have quitted the Thunder man of war, being obliged to sheer off for killing my captain, which I did fairly on the beach, at Cape Tiberoon, in the Island of Hispaniola; having received his fire and returned it, which went through his body: and I would serve the best man so that ever stepped between stem and stern, if so be that he struck me, as Captain Oakum did. I am (thank God) safe among the French, who are very civil, though I don\u2019t understand their lingo; and I hope to be restored in a little time, for all the great friends and parliamentary interest of the captain, for I have sent over to my landlord in Deal an account of the whole affair, with our bearings and distances while we were engaged, whereby I have desired him to lay it before his majesty, who (God bless him) will not suffer an honest tar to be wronged. My love to your spouse, and am\n\n\u2018Your loving friend and servant to command, while\n\u2018Thomas Bowling,\u2019\n\n\u2018To Roderick Random\n    \u2018Dear Rory,\n    \u2018Don\u2019t be grieved at my misfortune, but mind your book, my lad. I have got no money to send you, but what of that? Mr. Potion will take care of you for the love he bears to me, and let you want for nothing; and it shall go hard but I will see him one day repaid. No more at present, but rests\n\n\u2018Your dutiful uncle and servant, till death,\n\u2018Thomas Bowling.\u2019\n\nThis letter (which, with the other, was dated from Port Louis, in Hispaniola) I had no sooner read than the apothecary, shaking his head, began: \u201cI have a very great regard for Mr. Bowling that\u2019s certain; and could be well content\u2014but times are very hard. There\u2019s no such thing as money to be got; I believe \u2019tis all vanished under ground, for my part. Besides, I have been out of pocket already, having entertained you since the beginning of this month, without receiving a sixpence, and God knows if ever I shall; for I believe it will go hard with your uncle. And more than that, I was thinking of giving you warning, for I want your apartment for a new prentice, whom I expect from the country every hour. So I desire you will this week provide yourself with another lodging.\u201d\n\nThe indignation which this harangue inspired gave me spirits to support my reverse of fortune, and to tell him I despised his mean selfish disposition so much that I would rather starve than be beholden to him for one single meal. Upon which, out of my pocket money, I paid him to the last farthing of what I owed, and assured him, I would not sleep another night under his roof.\n\nThis said, I sallied out in a transport of rage and sorrow, without knowing whither to fly for shelter, having not one friend in the world capable of relieving me, and only three shillings in my purse. After giving way for a few minutes to the dictates of my rage, I went and hired a small bedroom, at the rate of one shilling and sixpence per week, which I was obliged to pay per advance, before the landlord would receive me: thither I removed my luggage; and next morning got up, with a view of craving the advice and assistance of a person who had on all occasions loaded me with caresses and made frequent offers of friendship, while I was under no necessity of accepting them. He received me with his wonted affability, and insisted on my breakfasting with him, a favour which I did not think fit to refuse. But when I communicated the occasion of my visit, he appeared so disconcerted that I concluded him wonderfully affected with the misery of my condition and looked upon him as a man of the most extensive sympathy and benevolence. He did not leave me long under this mistake; for, recovering himself from his confusion, he told me he was grieved at my misfortune, and desired to know what had passed between my landlord, Mr. Potion, and me. Whereupon I recounted the conversation; and, when I repeated the answer I made to his ungenerous remonstrance with regard to my leaving his house, this pretended friend affected a stare, and exclaimed, \u201cIs it possible you could behave so ill to the man who had treated you so kindly all along?\u201d\n\nMy surprise at hearing this was not at all affected, whatever his might be; and I gave to understand with some warmth, that I did not imagine he would so unreasonably espouse the cause of a scoundrel who ought to be expelled from every social community. This heat of mine gave him all the advantage he desired over me, and our discourse, after much altercation, concluded in his desiring never to see me again in that place; to which desire I yielded my consent, assuring him, that, had I been as well acquainted with his principles formerly as I was now, he never should have had an opportunity of making that request. And thus we parted.\n\nOn my return, I met my comrade, Squire Gawky, whom his father had sent, some time ago, to town, for his improvement in writing, dancing, fencing, and other modish qualifications. As I had lived with him since his arrival on the footing of our old intimacy, I made no scruple of informing him of the lowness of my circumstances, and asking a small supply of money, to answer my present expense; upon which he pulled out a handful of halfpence with a shilling or two among them, and swore that was all he had to keep his pocket till next quarter-day he having lost the greatest part of his allowance the night before at billiards. Though this assertion might very well be true, I was extremely mortified at his indifference: for he neither expressed any sympathy for my mishap nor desire of alleviating my distress; and accordingly I left him without uttering one word: but, when I afterwards understood that he was the person who had formerly betrayed me to the malice of my cousins, to whom likewise he had carried the tidings of my forlorn situation, which afforded them great matter of triumph and exultation, I determined with myself to call him to a severe account for which purpose I borrowed a sword, and wrote a challenge, desiring him to meet me at a certain time and place, that I might have an opportunity of punishing his perfidy, at the expense of his blood. He accepted the invitation, and I betook myself to the field, though not without feeling considerable repugnance to the combat, which frequently attacked me in cold sweats by the way; but the desire of revenge, the shame of retracting, and hope of conquest, conspired to repel these unmanly symptoms of fear; and I appeared on the plain with a good grace: there I waited an hour beyond the time appointed, and was not ill pleased to find he had no mind to meet me, because I should have an opportunity of exposing his cowardice, displaying my own courage, and of beating him soundly wheresoever I should find, without any dread of the consequence.\n\nElevated with these suggestions, which entirely banished all thoughts of my deplorable condition, I went directly to Gawky\u2019s lodgings, where I was informed of his precipitate retreat, he having set out for the country in less than an hour after he had received my billet; and I was vain enough to have the whole story inserted in the news, although I was fain to sell a gold laced hat to my landlord for less than half-price, to defray the expenses and contribute to my subsistence.\nCHAPTER VII\n\nI am entertained by Mr. Crab\u2014a description of him\u2014I acquire the Art of Surgery\u2014consult Crab\u2019s Disposition\u2014become necessary to him\u2014an Accident happens\u2014he advises me to launch out into the world\u2014assists me with Money\u2014I set out for London\n\nThe fumes of my resentment being dissipated, as well as the vanity of my success, I found myself deserted to all the horrors of extreme want, and avoided by mankind as a creature of a different species, or rather as a solitary being, noways comprehended within the scheme or protection of Providence. My despair had rendered me almost quite stupified, when I was one day told, that a gentleman desired to see me at a certain public-house, whither immediately I repaired; and was introduced to one Mr. Launcelot Crab, a surgeon in town, who was engaged with two more in drinking a liquor called pop-in, composed by mixing a quartern of brandy with a quart of small beer. Before I relate the occasion of this message, I believe it will not be disagreeable to the reader, if I describe the gentleman who sent for me, and mention some circumstances of his character and conduct which may illustrate what follows, and account for his behaviour to me.\n\nThis member of the faculty was aged fifty, about five feet high, and ten round the belly; his face was as capacious as a full moon, and much of the complexion of a mulberry: his nose, resembling a powder-horn, was swelled to an enormous size, and studded all over with carbuncles; and his little gray eyes reflected the rays in such an oblique manner that, while he looked a person full in the face, one would have imagined he was admiring the buckle of his shoe. He had long entertained an implacable resentment against Potion, who, though a younger practitioner, was better employed than he, and once had the assurance to perform a cure, whereby he disappointed and disgraced the prognostic of the said Crab. This quarrel which was at one time upon the point of being made up, by the interposition and mediation of friends, had been lately inflamed beyond a possibility of reconciliation by the respective wives of the opponents, who, chancing to meet at a christening, disagreed about precedence, proceeded from invectives to blows, and were with great difficulty, by the gossips, prevented from converting the occasion of joy into a scene of lamentation.\n\nThe difference between these rivals was in the height of rancour, when I received the message of Crab, who received me as civilly as I could have expected from one of his disposition; and, after desiring me to sit, inquired into the particulars of my leaving the house of Potion; which when I had related, he said, with a malicious grin, \u201cThere\u2019s a sneaking dog! I always thought him a fellow without a soul, d\u2014n me, a canting scoundrel, who has crept into business by his hypocrisy, and kissing the a\u2014e of every body.\u201d\u2014\u201cAy, ay,\u201d says another, \u201cone might see with half an eye that the rascal has no honesty in him, by his going so regularly to church.\u201d\n\nThis sentence was confirmed by a third, who assured his companions that Potion was never known to be disguised in liquor but once, at a meeting of the godly, where he had distinguished himself by an extempore prayer an hour long. After this preamble, Crab addressed himself to me in these words: \u201cWell, my lad, I have heard a good character of you, and I\u2019ll do for you. You may send your things to my house when you please. I have given orders for your reception. Zounds! What does the booby stare at? If you have no mind to embrace my courteous offer, you may let it alone, and be d\u2014d.\u201d I answered with a submissive bow, that I was far from rejecting his friendly offer, which I would immediately accept, as soon as he should inform me on what footing I was to be entertained. \u201cWhat footing! D\u2014n my blood,\u201d cried he, \u201cd\u2019ye expect to have a footman and a couple of horses kept for you?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d I replied, \u201cmy expectations are not quite so sanguine. That I may be as little burthensome as possible, I would willingly serve in your shop, by which means I may save you the expense of a journeyman, or porter at least, for I understand a little pharmacy, having employed some of my leisure hours in the practice of that art, while I lived with Mr. Potion; neither am I altogether ignorant of surgery, which I have studied with great pleasure and application.\u201d\u2014\u201cOho! you did,\u201d says Crab. \u201cGentlemen, here is a complete artist! Studied surgery! What? in books, I suppose. I shall have you disputing with me one of these days on points of my profession. You can already account for muscular motion, I warrant, and explain the mystery of the brain and nerves\u2014ha! You are too learned for me, d\u2014n me. But let\u2019s have no more of this stuff. Can you blood and give a clyster, spread a plaster, and prepare a potion?\u201d Upon my answering in the affirmative, he shock his head, telling me, he believed he should have little good of me, for all my promises; but, however, he would take me in for the sake of charity. I was accordingly that very night admitted to his house, and had an apartment assigned to me in the garret, which I was fain to put up with, notwithstanding the mortification my pride suffered in this change of circumstances.\n\nI was soon convinced of the real motives which induced Crab to receive me in this manner; for, besides the gratification of his revenge, by exposing the selfishness of his antagonist, in opposition to his own generosity, which was all affectation, he had occasion for a young man who understood something of the profession, to fill up the place of his eldest apprentice, lately dead, not without violent suspicion of foul play from his master\u2019s brutality. The knowledge of this circumstance, together with his daily behaviour to his wife and the young apprentice, did not at all contribute to my enjoying my new situation with ease; however, as I did not perceive how I could bestow myself to better advantage, I resolved to study Crab\u2019s temper with all the application, and manage it with all the address in my power. And it was not long before I found out a strange peculiarity of humour which governed his behaviour towards all his dependents. I observed, when he was pleased, he was such a niggard of his satisfaction that, if his wife or servants betrayed the least symptom of participation, he was offended to an insupportable degree of choler and fury, the effects of which they seldom failed to feel. And when his indignation was roused, submission and soothing always exasperated it beyond the bounds of reason and humanity. I therefore pursued a contrary plan; and one day, when he honoured me with the names of ignorant whelp and lazy ragamuffin, I boldly replied, I was neither ignorant nor lazy, since I both understood and performed my business as well as he could do for his soul; neither was it just to call me ragamuffin, for I had a whole coat on my back, and was descended from a better family than any he could boast an alliance with.\n\nHe gave tokens of great amazement at this assurance of mine, and shook his cane over my head, regarding me all the time with a countenance truly diabolical. Although I was terribly startled at his menacing looks and posture, I yet had reflection enough left to convince me I had gone too far to retract, and that this was the critical minute which must decide my future lot in his service; I therefore snatched up the pestle of a mortar, and swore, if he offered to strike me without a cause, I should see whether his skull or my weapon was hardest.\n\nHe continued silent for some time, and at last broke forth into these ejaculations: \u201cThis is fine usage from a servant to his master\u2014very fine! damnation! but no matter, you shall pay for this, you dog, you shall; I\u2019ll do your business\u2014yes, yes, I\u2019ll teach you to lift your hand against me.\u201d So saying, he retired, and left me under dreadful apprehensions, which vanished entirely at our next meeting, when he behaved with unusual complacency, and treated me with a glass of punch after dinner.\n\nBy this conduct I got the ascendancy over him in a short time, and became so necessary to him, in managing his business while he was engaged at the bottle, that fortune began to wear a kinder aspect; and I consoled myself for the disregard of my former acquaintance, with the knowledge I daily imbibed by a close application to the duties of my employment, in which I succeeded beyond my own expectation. I was on very good terms with my master\u2019s wife, whose esteem I acquired and cultivated, by representing Mrs. Potion in the most ridiculous lights my satirical talents could invent, as well as by rendering her some Christian offices, when she had been too familiar with the dram bottle, to which she had oftentimes recourse for consolation, under the affliction she suffered from a barbarous husband.\n\nIn this manner I lived, without hearing the least tidings of my uncle for the space of two years, during which time I kept little or no company, being neither in a humour to relish nor in a capacity to maintain much acquaintance; for the Nabal my master allowed me no wages, and the small perquisites of my station scarcely supplied me with the common necessaries of life. I was no longer a pert unthinking coxcomb, giddy with popular applause, and elevated with the extravagance of hope: my misfortunes had taught me how little the caresses of the world, during a man\u2019s prosperity, are to be valued by him; and how seriously and expeditiously he ought to set about making himself independent of them. My present appearance, therefore, was the least of my care, which was wholly engrossed in laying up a stock of instruction that might secure me against the caprice of fortune for the future. I became such a sloven, and contracted such an air of austerity, that everybody pronounced me crestfallen; and Gawky returned to town without running any risk from my resentment, which was by this time pretty much cooled, and restrained by prudential reasons so effectually that I never so much as thought of obtaining satisfaction for the injuries he had done me.\n\nWhen I deemed myself sufficiently master of my business I began to cast about for an opportunity of launching into the world, in hope of finding some provision that might make amends for the difficulties I had undergone; but, as this could not be effected without a small sum of money to equip me for the field, I was in the utmost perplexity how to raise it, well knowing that Crab, for his own sake, would never put me in a condition to leave him, when his interest was so much concerned in my stay. But a small accident, which happened about this time, determined him in my favour. This was no other than the pregnancy of his maidservant, who declared her situation to me, assuring me at the same time that I was the occasion of it.\n\nAlthough I had no reason to question the truth of this imputation, I was not ignorant of the familiarities which had passed between her master and her, taking the advantage of which I represented to her the folly of laying the burden at my door, when she might dispose of it to much better purpose with Mr. Crab. She listened to my advice, and next day acquainted him with the pretended success of their mutual endeavours. He was far from being overjoyed at this proof of his vigour, which he foresaw might have very troublesome consequences; not that he dreaded any domestic grumblings and reproaches from his wife, whom he kept in perfect subjection; but because he knew it would furnish his rival Potion with a handle for insulting and undermining his reputation, there being no scandal equal to that of uncleanness, in the opinion of those who inhabit the part of the island where he lived. He therefore took a resolution worthy of himself, which was, to persuade the girl that she was not with child, but only afflicted with a disorder incidental to young women, which he could easily remove: with this view (as he pretended) he prescribed for her such medicines as he thought would infallibly procure abortion; but in this scheme he was disappointed, for the maid, being advertised by me of his design, and at the same time well acquainted with her own condition, absolutely refused to follow his directions; and threatened to publish her situation to the world if he would not immediately take some method of providing for the important occasion, which she expected in a few months. It was not long before I guessed the result of his deliberation, by his addressing himself to me one day in this manner: \u201cI am surprised that a young fellow like you discovers no inclination to push his fortune in the world. Before I was of your age I was broiling on the coast of Guinea. D\u2014e! what\u2019s to hinder you from profiting by the war which will certainly be declared in a short time against Spain? You may easily get on board of a king\u2019s ship in quality of surgeon\u2019s mate, where you will certainly see a great deal of practice, and stand a good chance of getting prize-money.\u201d\n\nI laid hold of this declaration, which I had long wished for, and assured him I would follow his advice with pleasure, if it were in my power; but that it was impossible for me to embrace an opportunity of that kind, as I had no friend to advance a little money to supply me with what necessaries I should want, and defray the expenses of my journey to London. He told me that few necessaries were required; and, as for the expense of my journey, he would lend me money, sufficient not only for that purpose, but also to maintain me comfortably in London until I should procure a warrant for my provision on board of some ship.\n\nI gave him a thousand thanks for his obliging offer (although I was very well apprised of his motive, which was no other than a design to lay the bastard to my charge after my departure), and accordingly set out in a few weeks for London; my whole fortune consisting of one suit of clothes, half a dozen ruffled shirts, as many plain, two pair of worsted and a like number of threaded stockings; a case of pocket instruments, a small edition of Horace, Wiseman\u2019s Surgery, and ten guineas in cash; for which Crab took my bond, bearing five per cent interest; at the same time giving me a letter to a member of parliament for our town, which he said would do my business effectually.\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nI arrive at Newcastle\u2014meet with my old Schoolfellow Strap\u2014we determine to walk together to London\u2014set out on our Journey\u2014put up at a solitary Alehouse\u2014are disturbed by a strange Adventure in the Night\n\nThere is no such convenience as a waggon in this country, and my finances were too weak to support the expense of hiring a horse: I determined therefore to set out with the carriers, who transport goods from one place to another on horseback; and this scheme I accordingly put in execution on the 1st day of September, 1739, sitting upon a pack-saddle between two baskets, one of which contained my goods in a knapsack. But by the time we arrived at Newcastle-upon-Tyne I was so fatigued with the tediousness of the carriage, and benumbed with the coldness of the weather, that I resolved to travel the rest of my journey on foot, rather than proceed in such a disagreeable manner.\n\nThe ostler of the inn at which we put up, understanding I was bound for London, advised me to take my passage in a collier which would be both cheap and expeditious and withal much easier than to walk upwards of three hundred miles through deep roads in the winter time, a journey which he believed I had not strength enough to perform. I was almost persuaded to take his advice, when one day, stepping into a barber\u2019s shop to be shaved, the young man, while he lathered my face, accosted me thus: \u201cSir, I presume you are a Scotchman.\u201d I answered in the affirmative. \u201cPray,\u201d continued he, \u201cfrom what part of Scotland?\u201d I no sooner told him, than he discovered great emotion, and not confining his operation to my chin and upper lip, besmeared my whole face with great agitation. I was so offended at this profusion that starting up, I asked him what the d\u2014l he meant by using me so? He begged pardon, telling me his joy at meeting with a countryman had occasioned some confusion in him, and craved my name. But, when I declared my name was Random, he exclaimed in rapture, \u201cHow! Rory Random?\u201d \u201cThe same,\u201d I replied, looking at him with astonishment. \u201cWhat!\u201d cried he, \u201cdon\u2019t you know your old schoolfellow, Hugh Strap?\u201d\n\nAt that instant recollecting his face, I flew into his arms, and in the transport of my joy, gave him back one-half of the suds he had so lavishly bestowed on my countenance; so that we made a very ludicrous appearance, and furnished a great deal of mirth for his master and shopmates, who were witnesses of this scene. When our mutual caresses were over I sat down again to be shaved, but the poor fellow\u2019s nerves were so discomposed by this unexpected meeting that his hand could scarcely hold the razor, with which, nevertheless, he found means to cut me in three places in as many strokes. His master, perceiving his disorder, bade another supply his place, and after the operation was performed, gave Strap leave to pass the rest of the day with me.\n\nWe retired immediately to my lodgings, where, calling for some beer, I desired to be informed of his adventures, which contained nothing more than that his master dying before his time was out, he had come to Newcastle about a year ago, in expectation of journeywork, along with three young fellows of his acquaintance who worked in the keels; that he had the good fortune of being employed by a very civil master, with whom he intended to stay till the spring, at which time he proposed to go to London, where he did not doubt of finding encouragement. When I communicated to him my situation and design, he did not approve of my taking a passage by sea, by reason of the danger of a winter voyage, which is very hazardous along that coast, as well as the precariousness of the wind, which might possibly detain me a great while, to the no small detriment of my fortune; whereas, if I would venture by land, he would bear me company, carry my baggage all the way, and if we should be fatigued before we could perform the journey it would be no hard matter for us to find on the road either return horses or waggons, of which we might take the advantage for a very trifling expense.\n\nI was so ravished at this proposal that I embraced him affectionately, and assured him he might command my purse to the last farthing; but he gave me to understand he had saved money sufficient to answer his own occasions; and that he had a friend in London who would soon introduce him into business in that capital, and possibly have it in his power to serve me also.\n\nHaving concerted the plan and settled our affairs that night, we departed next morning by daybreak, armed with a good cudgel each (my companion being charged with the furniture of us both crammed into one knapsack), and our money sewed between the linings and waistbands of our breeches, except some loose silver for our immediate expenses on the road, We travelled all day at a round pace, but, being ignorant of the proper stages, were benighted at a good distance from any inn, so that we were compelled to take up our lodging at a small hedge alehouse, that stood on a byroad, about half-a-mile from the highway: there we found a pedlar of our own country, in whose company we regaled ourselves with bacon and eggs, and a glass of good ale, before a comfortable fire, conversing all the while very sociably with the landlord and his daughter, a hale buxom lass, who entertained us with great good humour, and in whose affection I was vain enough to believe I had made some progress. About eight o\u2019clock we were all three, at our own desire, shown into an apartment furnished with two beds, in one of which Strap and I betook ourselves to rest, and the pedlar occupied the other, though not before he had prayed a considerable time extempore, searched into every corner of the room, and fastened the door on the inside with a strong iron screw, which he carried about with him for that use.\n\nI slept very sound till midnight when I was disturbed by a violent motion of the bed, which shook under me with a continual tremor. Alarmed at this phenomenon, I jogged my companion, whom, to my no small amazement, I found drenched in sweat, and quaking through every limb; he told me, with a low faltering voice, that we were undone; for there was a bloody highwayman, loaded with pistols, in the next room; then, bidding me make as little noise as possible, he directed me to a small chink in the board partition through which I could see a thick-set brawny fellow, with a fierce countenance, sitting at a table with our young landlady, having a bottle of ale and a brace of pistols before him.\n\nI listened with great attention, and heard him say, in a terrible tone, \u201cD\u2014n that son of a b\u2014h, Smack the coachman; he has served me a fine trick, indeed! but d\u2014ion seize me, if I don\u2019t make him repent it! I\u2019ll teach the scoundrel to give intelligence to others while he is under articles with me.\u201d\n\nOur landlady endeavoured to appease this exasperated robber, by saying he might be mistaken in Smack, who perhaps kept no correspondence with the other gentleman that robbed his coach; and that, if an accident had disappointed him to-day, he might soon find opportunities enough to atone for his lost trouble. \u201cI\u2019ll tell thee what, my dear Bet,\u201d replied he, \u201cI never had, nor ever shall, while my name is Rifle, have such a glorious booty as I missed to-day. Z\u2014s! there was \xa3400 in cash to recruit men for the king\u2019s service, besides the jewels, watches, swords, and money belonging to the passengers. Had it been my fortune to have got clear off with so much treasure, I would have purchased a commission in the army, and made you an officer\u2019s lady, you jade, I would.\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d cries Betty, \u201cwe must trust to Providence for that. But did you find nothing worth taking which escaped the other gentlemen of the road?\u201d \u201cNot much, faith,\u201d said the lover; \u201cI gleaned a few things, such as a pair of pops, silver mounted (here they are): I took them loaded from the captain who had the charge of the money, together with a gold watch which he had concealed in his breeches. I likewise found ten Portugal pieces in the shoes of a quaker, whom the spirit moved to revile me with great bitterness and devotion; but what I value myself mostly for is, this here purchase, a gold snuffbox, my girl, with a picture on the inside of the lid; which I untied out of the tail of a pretty lady\u2019s smock.\u201d\n\nHere, as the devil would have it, the pedlar snored so loud, that the highwayman, snatching his pistols, started up, crying, \u201cHell and d-n-n! I am betrayed! Who\u2019s that in the next room?\u201d Mrs. Betty told him he need not be uneasy: there were only three poor travellers, who, missing the road, had taken up their lodgings in the house, and were asleep long ago. \u201cTravellers,\u201d says he, \u201cspies, you b\u2014ch! But no matter; I\u2019ll send them all to hell in an instant!\u201d He accordingly ran towards our door; when his sweetheart interposing, assured him, there was only a couple of poor young Scotchmen, who were too raw and ignorant to give him the least cause of suspicion; and the third was a presbyterian pedlar of the same nation, who had often lodged in the house before.\n\nThis declaration satisfied the thief, who swore he was glad there was a pedlar, for he wanted some linen. Then, in a jovial manner, he put about the glass, mingling his discourse to Betty with caresses and familiarities, that spoke him very happy in his amours. During that part of the conversation which regarded this, Strap had crept under the bed, where he lay in the agonies of fear; so that it was with great difficulty I persuaded him our danger was over, and prevailed on him to awake the pedlar, and inform him of what he had seen and heard.\n\nThe itinerant merchant no sooner felt somebody shaking him by the shoulder, than he started up, called, as loud as he could, \u201cThieves, thieves! Lord have mercy upon us!\u201d And Rifle, alarmed at this exclamation, jumped up, cocked one of his pistols, and turned towards the door to kill the first man that should enter; for he verily believed himself beset: when his Dulcinea, after an immoderate fit of laughter, persuaded him that the poor pedlar, dreaming of thieves, had only cried out in his sleep.\n\nMeanwhile, my comrade had undeceived our fellow-lodger, and informed him of his reason for disturbing him; upon which, getting up softly, he peeped through the hole, and was so terrified with what he saw, that, falling down on his bare knees, he put up a long petition to Heaven to deliver him from the hands of that ruffian, and promised never to defraud a customer for the future of the value of a pin\u2019s point, provided he might be rescued from the present danger. Whether or not his disburthening his conscience afforded him any ease I knew not, but he slipped into bed again, and lay very quiet until the robber and his mistress were asleep, and snored in concert; then, rising softly, he untied a rope that was round his pack, which making fast to one end of it, he opened the window with as little noise as possible, and lowered his goods into the yard with great dexterity: then he moved gently to our bedside and bade us farewell, telling us that, as we ran no risk we might take our rest with great confidence, and in the morning assure the landlord that we knew nothing of his escape, and, lastly, shaking us by the hands, and wishing us all manner of success, he let himself drop from the window without any danger, for the ground was not above a yard from his feet as he hung on the outside.\n\nAlthough I did not think proper to accompany him in his flight, I was not at all free from apprehension when I reflected on what might be the effect of the highwayman\u2019s disappointment; as he certainly intended to make free with the pedlar\u2019s ware. Neither was my companion at more ease in his mind, but on the contrary, so possessed with the dreadful idea of Rifle, that he solicited me strongly to follow our countryman\u2019s example, and so elude the fatal resentment of that terrible adventurer, who would certainly wreak his vengeance on us as accomplices of the pedlar\u2019s elopement. But I represented to him the danger of giving Rifle cause to think we know his profession, and suggested that, if ever he should meet us again on the road, he would look upon us as dangerous acquaintance, and find it his interest to put us out of the way. I told him, withal, my confidence in Betty\u2019s good nature, in which he acquiesced; and during the remaining part of the night we concerted a proper method of behaviour, to render us unsuspected in the morning.\n\nIt was no sooner day than Betty, entering our chamber, and perceiving our window open, cried out, \u201cOdds-bobs! sure you Scotchmen must have hot constitutions to lie all night with the window open in such cold weather.\u201d I feigned to start out of sleep, and, withdrawing the curtain, called, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d When she showed me, I affected surprise, and said, \u201cBless me! the window was shut when we went to bed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be hanged,\u201d said she, \u201cif Sawney Waddle, the pedlar, has not got up in a dream and done it, for I heard him very obstropulous in his sleep.\u2014Sure I put a chamberpot under his bed!\u201d\n\nWith these words she advanced to the bed, in which he lay, and, finding the sheets cold, exclaimed, \u201cGood lackadaisy! The rogue is fled.\u201d \u201cFled,\u201d cried I, with feigned amazement, \u201cGod forbid! Sure he has not robbed us!\u201d Then, springing up, I laid hold of my breeches, and emptied all my loose money into my hand; which having reckoned, I said, \u201cHeaven be praised, our money is all safe! Strap, look to the knapsack.\u201d He did so, and found all was right. Upon which we asked, with seeming concern, if he had stolen nothing belonging to the house. \u201cNo, no,\u201d replied she, \u201che has stole nothing but his reckoning;\u201d which, it seems, this pious pedlar had forgot to discharge in the midst of his devotion.\n\nBetty, after a moment\u2019s pause withdrew, and immediately we could hear her waken Rifle, who no sooner heard of Waddle\u2019s flight than he jumped out of bed and dressed, venting a thousand execrations, and vowing to murder the pedlar if ever he should set eyes on him again: \u201cFor,\u201d said he \u201cthe scoundrel has by this time raised the hue and cry against me.\u201d\n\nHaving dressed himself in a hurry, he mounted his horse, and for that time rid us of his company and a thousand fears that were the consequence of it.\n\nWhile we were at breakfast, Betty endeavoured, by all the cunning she was mistress of, to learn whether or no we suspected our fellow-lodger, whom we saw take horse; but, as we were on our guard, we answered her sly questions with a simplicity she could not distrust; when, all of a sudden, we heard the trampling of a horse\u2019s feet at the door. This noise alarmed Strap so much, whose imagination was wholly engrossed by the image of Rifle, that, with a countenance as pale as milk, he cried, \u201cO Lord! there is the highwayman returned!\u201d\n\nOur landlady, staring at these words, said, \u201cWhat highwayman, young man? Do you think any highwaymen harbour here?\u201d\n\nThough I was very much disconcerted at this piece of indiscretion in Strap, I had presence of mind enough to tell her we had met a horseman the day before, whom Strap had foolishly supposed to be a highwayman, because he rode with pistols; and that he had been terrified at the sound of a horse\u2019s feet ever since.\n\nShe forced a smile at the ignorance and timidity of my comrade; but I could perceive, not without great concern, that this account was not at all satisfactory to her.\nCHAPTER IX\n\nWe proceed on our Journey\u2014are overtaken by a Highwayman who fires at Strap\u2014is prevented from shooting me by a Company of Horsemen, who ride in pursuit of him\u2014Strap is put to Bed at an Inn\u2014Adventures at that Inn\n\nAfter having paid our score and taken leave of our hostess, who embraced me tenderly at parting, we proceeded on our journey, blessing ourselves that we had come off so well. We had not walked above five miles, when we observed a man on horseback galloping after us, whom we in a short time recognised to be no other than this formidable hero who had already given us so much vexation. He stopped hard by me, and asked if I knew who he was? My astonishment had disconcerted me so much that I did not hear his question, which he repeated with a volley of oaths and threats; but I remained as mute as before.\n\nStrap, seeing my discomposure, fell upon his knees in the mud, uttering, with a lamentable voice, these words: \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, have mercy upon us, Mr. Rifle! we know you very well.\u201d \u201cOho!\u201d cried the thief, \u201cyou do! But you never shall be evidence against me in this world, you dog!\u201d So saying, he drew a pistol, and fired it at the unfortunate shaver, who fell flat upon the ground without speaking one word.\n\nMy comrade\u2019s fate and my own situation riveted me to the place where I stood, deprived of all sense and reflection; so that I did not make the least attempt either to run away or deprecate the wrath of this barbarian, who snapped a second pistol at me; but, before he had time to prime again, perceiving a company of horsemen coming up, he rode off, and left me standing motionless as a statue, in which posture I was found by those whose appearance had saved my life. This company consisted of three men in livery, well armed, with an officer, who (as I afterwards learned,) was the person from whom Rifle had taken the pocket pistols the day before; and who, making known his misfortune to a nobleman he met on the road, and assuring him his non-resistance was altogether owing to his consideration for the ladies in the coach, procured the assistance of his lordship\u2019s servants to go in quest of the plunderer. This holiday captain scampered up to me with great address, and asked who fired the pistol which he had heard.\n\nAs I had not yet recovered my reason, he, before I could answer, observed a body lying on the ground, at which sight his colour changed, and he pronounced, with a faltering tongue, \u201cGentlemen, here\u2019s murder committed! Let us alight.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d said one of his followers, \u201clet us rather pursue the murderer. Which way went he, young man?\u201d\n\nBy this time I had recollected myself so far as to tell them that he could not be a quarter of a mile before; and to beg one of them to assist me in conveying the corpse of my friend to the next house, in order to it being interred. The captain, foreseeing that, in case he should pursue, he must soon come to action, began to curb his horse, and gave him the spur at the same time, which treatment making the creature rear up and snort, he called out, his horse was frightened, and would not proceed; at the same time wheeling him round and round, stroking his neck, whistling and wheedling him with \u201cSirrah, sirrah\u2014gently, gently.\u201d etc. \u201cZ\u2014ds!\u201d, cried one of the servants, \u201csure my lord\u2019s Sorrel is not resty!\u201d\n\nWith these words he bestowed a lash on his buttocks, and Sorrel, disdaining the rein sprang forward with the captain at a pace that would have soon brought him up with the robber, had not the girtle (happily for him) given way, by which means he landed in the dirt; and two of his attendants continued their pursuit, without minding his situation. Meanwhile one of the three who remained at my desire, turning the body of Strap, in order to see the wound which had killed him, found him still warm and breathing: upon which, I immediately let him blood, and saw him, with inexpressible joy, recover; he having received no other wound than what his fear had inflicted. Having raised him upon his legs, we walked together to an inn, about half a mile from the place, where Strap, who was not quite recovered, went to bed; and in a little time the third servant returned with the captain\u2019s horse and furniture, leaving him to crawl after as well as he could.\n\nThis gentleman of the sword, upon his arrival, complained grievously of the bruise occasioned by his fall; and, on the recommendation of the servant, who warranted my ability, I was employed to bleed him, for which service he rewarded me with half-a-crown.\n\nThe time between this event and dinner I passed in observing a game at cards between two farmers, an exciseman, and a young fellow in a rusty gown and cassock, who, as I afterwards understood, was curate of a neighbouring parish. It was easy to perceive that the match was not equal; and that the two farmers, who were partners, had to do with a couple of sharpers, who stripped them of all their cash in a very short time. But what surprised me very much, was to hear this clergyman reply to one of the countrymen, who seemed to suspect foul play, in these words: \u201cD\u2014n me, friend, d\u2019ye question my honour?\u201d\n\nI did not at all wonder to find a cheat in canonicals, this being a character frequent in my own country; but I was scandalised at the indecency of his behaviour, which appeared in the oaths he swore, and the bawdy songs which he sung. At last, to make amends in some sort, for the damage he had done to the unwary boors, he pulled out a fiddle from the lining of his gown, and, promising to treat them at dinner, began to play most melodiously, singing in concert all the while. This good humour of this parson inspired the company with so much glee that the farmers soon forgot their losses, and all present went to dancing in the yard.\n\nWhile we were agreeably amused in this manner, our musician, spying a horseman a riding towards the inn, stopped all of a sudden, crying out, \u201cGad so! gentlemen, I beg your pardon, there\u2019s our dog of a doctor coming into the inn.\u201d He immediately commended his instrument, and ran towards the gate, where he took hold of the vicar\u2019s bridle, and helped him off, inquiring very cordially into the state of his health.\n\nThis rosy son of the church, who might be about the age of fifty, having alighted and entrusted the curate with his horse, stalked with great solemnity, into the kitchen, where sitting down by the fire, he called for a bottle of ale and a pipe; scarce deigning an answer to the submissive questions of those who inquired about the welfare of his family. While he indulged himself in this state, amidst a profound silence, the curate, approaching him with great reverence, asked him if he would not be pleased to honour him with his company at dinner? To which interrogation he answered in the negative, saying, he had been to visit Squire Bumpkin, who had drank himself into a high fever at the last assizes; and that he had, on leaving his own house, told Betty he should dine at home. Accordingly when he had made an end of his bottle and pipe, he rose, and moved with prelatical dignity to the door, where his journeyman stood ready with his nag. He had no sooner mounted than the facetious curate, coming into the kitchen, held forth in this manner: \u201cThere the old rascal goes, and the d\u2014l go with him. You see how the world wags, gentlemen. By gad, this rogue of a vicar does not deserve to live; and yet he has two livings worth four hundred pounds per annum, while poor I am fain to do all his drudgery, and ride twenty miles every Sunday to preach\u2014for what? why, truly, for twenty pounds a year. I scorn to boast of my own qualifications but\u2014comparisons are odious. I should be glad to know how this wag-bellied doctor deserves to be more at ease than me. He can loll in his elbow chair at home, indulge himself in the best of victuals and wine and enjoy the conversation of Betty, his housekeeper. You understand me, gentlemen. Betty is the doctor\u2019s poor kinswoman, and a pretty girl she is; but no matter for that; ay, and dutiful girl to her parents, whom she visits regularly every year, though I must own I could never learn in what county they live, My service t\u2019ye, gentlemen.\u201d\n\nBy this time dinner being ready, I waked my companion, and we ate altogether with great cheerfulness. When our meal was ended, and every man\u2019s share of the reckoning adjusted, the curate went out on pretence of some necessary occasion, and, mounting his house, left the two farmers to satisfy the host in the best manner they could. We were no sooner informed of this piece of finesse, than the exciseman, who had been silent hitherto, began to open with a malicious grin: \u201cAy, ay this is an old trick of Shuffle; I could not help smiling when he talked of treating. You must know this is a very curious fellow. He picked up some scraps of learning while he served young Lord Trifte at the university. But what he most excels in is pimping. No one knows his talents better than I, for I was valet-de-chambre to Squire Tattle an intimate companion of Shuffle\u2019s lord. He got him self into a scrape by pawning some of his lordship\u2019s clothes on which account he was turned away; but, as he was acquainted with some particular circumstances of my lord\u2019s conduct, he did not care to exasperate him too much, and so made interest for his receiving orders, and afterwards recommended him to the curacy which he now enjoys. However, the fellow cannot be too much admired for his dexterity in making a comfortable livelihood, in spite of such a small allowance. You hear he plays a good stick, and is really diverting company; these qualifications make him agreeable wherever he goes; and, as for playing at cards there is not a man within three counties for him. The truth is, he is a d\u2014able cheat, and can shift a card with such address that it is impossible to discover him.\u201d\n\nHere he was interrupted by one of the farmers, who asked, why he had not justice enough to acquaint them with these particulars before they engaged in play. The exciseman replied, without any hesitation, that it was none of his business to intermeddle between man and man; besides, he did not know they were ignorant of Shuffle\u2019s character, which was notorious to the whole country. This did not satisfy the other, who taxed him with abetting and assisting the curate\u2019s knavery, and insisted on having his share of the winnings returned; this demand the exciseman as positively refused affirming that, whatever sleights Shuffle might practise on other occasions, he was very certain that he had played on the square with them, and would answer it before any bench in Christendom; so saying, he got up and, having paid his reckoning, sneaked off.\n\nThe Landlord, thrusting his neck into the passage to see if he was gone, shook his head, saying, \u201cAh! Lord help us! if every sinner was to have his deserts. Well, we victuallers must not disoblige the excisemen. But I know what; if parson Shuffle and he were weighed together, a straw thrown into either scale would make the balance kick the beam. But, masters, this is under the rose,\u201d continued Boniface with a whisper.\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe Highwayman is taken\u2014we are detained as Evidence against him\u2014proceed to the next village\u2014he escapes\u2014we arrive at another inn, where we go to Bed\u2014in the Night we are awaked by a dreadful Adventure\u2014next night we lodge at the house of a Schoolmaster\u2014our Treatment there\n\nStrap and I were about to depart on our journey, when we perceived a crowd on the road coming towards us, shouting and hallooing all the way. As it approached, we could discern a man on horseback in the middle, with his hands tied behind him, whom we soon knew to be Rifle. The highwayman, not being so well mounted as the two servants who went in pursuit of him, was soon overtaken, and, after having discharged his pistols, made prisoner without any further opposition. They were carrying him in triumph, amidst the acclamations of the country people, to a justice of peace in a neighbouring village, but stopped at our inn to join their companions and take refreshment.\n\nWhen Rifle was dismounted and placed in the yard, within a circle of peasants, armed with pitchforks, I was amazed to see what a pitiful dejected fellow he now appeared, who had but a few hours before filled me with such terror and confusion. My companion was so much encouraged by this alteration in his appearance that, going up to the thief, he presented his clenched fists to his nose, and declared he would either cudgel or box with the prisoner for a guinea, which he immediately produced, and began to strip, but was dissuaded from this adventure by me, who represented to him the folly of the undertaking, as Rifle was now in the hands of justice, which would, no doubt, give us all satisfaction enough.\n\nBut what made me repent of our impertinent curiosity was our being detained by the captors, as evidence against him, when we were just going to set forward. However, there was no remedy; we were obliged to comply, and accordingly joined in the cavalcade, which luckily took the same road that we had proposed to follow. About the twilight we arrived at the place of our destination, but as the justice was gone to visit a gentleman in the country, with whom (we understood) he would probably stay all night, the robber was confined in an empty garret, three stories high, from which it seemed impossible for him to escape; this, nevertheless, was the case; for next morning when they went up stairs to bring him before the justice, the bird was flown, having got out at the window upon the roof from whence he continued his route along the tops of the adjoining houses, and entered another garret where he skulked until the family were asleep; at which time he ventured down stairs, and let himself out by the street-door, which was open.\n\nThis event was a great disappointment to those that apprehended him, who were flushed with the hopes of the reward; but gave me great joy, as I was permitted now to continue my journey, without any further molestation. Resolving to make up for the small progress we had hitherto made, we this day travelled with great vigour and before night reached a market town twenty miles from the place from whence we set out in the morning, without meeting any adventure worth notice. Here having taken up our lodging at an an inn, I found myself so fatigued that I began to despair of performing our journey on foot, and desired Strap to inquire if there were any waggon, return horses, or any cheap carriage in this place, to depart for London next day. He was informed that the waggon from Newcastle to London had halted there two nights ago, and that it would be an easy matter to overtake it, if not the next day, at farthest, the day after the next. This piece of news gave us some satisfaction; and, after having made a hearty supper on hashed mutton, we were shown to our room, which contained two beds, the one allotted for us, and the other for a very honest gentleman, who, we were told, was then drinking below. Though we could have very well dispensed with his company, we were glad to submit to this disposition, as there was not another bed empty in the house; and accordingly went to rest, after having secured our baggage under the bolster. About two or three o\u2019clock in the morning I was awaked out of a very profound sleep by a dreadful noise in the chamber, which did not fail to throw me into an agony of consternation, when I heard these words pronounced with a terrible voice: \u201cBlood and wounds! run the halbert into the guts of him that\u2019s next you, and I\u2019ll blow the other\u2019s brains out presently.\u201d\n\nThis dreadful salutation had no sooner reached the ears of Strap than, starting out of bed, he ran against somebody in the dark, and overturned him in an instant; at the same time bawling out, \u201cFire! murder! fire!\u201d a cry which in a moment alarmed the whole house, and filled our chamber with a crowd of naked people. When lights were brought, the occasion of all this disturbance soon appeared; which was no other than a fellow lodger, whom we found lying on the floor, scratching his head, with a look testifying the utmost astonishment at the concourse of apparitions that surrounded him.\n\nThis honest gentleman was, it seems, a recruiting sergeant, who, having listed two country fellows over night, dreaded they had mutinied, and threatened to murder him and the drummer who was along with him. This made such an impression on his imagination, that he got up in his sleep and expressed himself as above. When our apprehension of danger vanished, the company beheld one another with great surprise and mirth; but what attracted the notice of everyone was our landlady, with nothing on her but her shift and a large pair of buckskin breeches, with the backside before, which she had slipped on in the hurry, and her husband with her petticoat about his shoulders; one had wrapped himself in a blanket, another was covered with a sheet, and the drummer, who had given his only shirt to be washed, appeared in cuerpo with a bolster rolled about his middle.\n\nWhen this affair was discussed, everybody retired to his own apartment, the sergeant slipped into bed, and my companion and I slept without any further disturbance till morning, when we got up, went to breakfast, paid our reckoning, and set forward in expectation of overtaking the waggon; in which hope, however, we were disappointed for that day. As we exerted ourselves more than usual, I found myself quite spent with fatigue, when we entered a small village in the twilight. We inquired for a public-house, and were directed to one of a very sorry appearance. At our entrance the landlord, who seemed to be a venerable old man, with long gray hair, rose from a table placed by a large fire in a very neat paved kitchen, and with a cheerful countenance accosted us in these words: \u201cSalvete, pueri. Ingredimini.\u201d I was not a little pleased to hear our host speak Latin, because I was in hope of recommending myself to him by my knowledge in that language; I therefore answered, without hesitation, \u201cDissolve frigus, ligna super foco\u2014large reponens.\u201d I had no sooner pronounced these words, than the old gentleman, running towards me, shook me by the hand, crying, \u201cFili mi dilectissime! unde venis?\u2014a superis, ni fallor?\u201d In short, finding we were both read in the classics, he did not know how to testify his regard enough; but ordered his daughter, a jolly rosy-cheeked damsel who was his sole domestic, to bring us a bottle of his quadrimum, repeating from Horace at the same time, \u201cDeprome quadrimum sabina, O Tholiarche, merum diota.\u201d This was excellent ale of his own brewing, of which he told us he had always an amphora four years old, for the use of himself and friends.\n\nIn the course of our conversation, which was interlarded with scraps of Latin, we understood that this facetious person was a schoolmaster, whose income being small, he was fain to keep a glass of good liquor for the entertainment of passengers by which he made shift to make the two ends of the year meet. \u201cI am this day,\u201d said he, \u201cthe happiest old fellow in his majesty\u2019s dominions. My wife, rest her soul, is in heaven. My daughter is to be married next week; but the two chief pleasures of my life are these (pointing to the bottle and a large edition of Horace that lay on the table). I am old, \u2019tis true\u2014what then? the more reason I should enjoy the small share of life that remains, as my friend Flaccus advises: \u2018Tu ne quaesieris (scire nefas) quem mihi, quem tibi finem dii dederint. Carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs he was very inquisitive about our affairs, we made no scruple of acquainting him with our situation, which when he had learned, he enriched us with advices how to behave in the world, telling us that he was no stranger to the deceits of mankind. In the meantime he ordered his daughter to lay a fowl to the fire for supper, for he was resolved this night to regale his friends\u2014permittens divis caetera. While our entertainment was preparing, our host recounted the adventures of his own life, which, as they contained nothing remarkable, I forbear to rehearse. When we had fared sumptuously, and drunk several bottles of his I expressed a desire of going to rest, which was with some difficulty complied with, after he had informed us that we should overtake the waggon by noon next day; and that there was room enough in it for half-a-dozen, for there were only four passengers as yet in that convenience.\n\nBefore my comrade and I fell asleep, we had some conversation about the good humour of our landlord, which gave Strap such an idea of his benevolence, that he positively believed we should pay nothing for our lodging and entertainment. \u201cDon\u2019t you observe,\u201d said he, \u201cthat he has conceived a particular affection for us\u2014nay, even treated us at supper with extraordinary fare, which, to be sure, we should not of ourselves have called for?\u201d\n\nI was partly of Strap\u2019s opinion; but the experience I had of the world made me suspend my belief till the morning, when, getting up betimes, we breakfasted with our host and his daughter on hasty-pudding and ale, and desired to know what we had to pay. \u201cBiddy will let you know, gentlemen,\u201d said he; \u201cfor I never mind these matters. Money matters are beneath the concern of one who lives upon the Horatian plan\u2014Crescentum sequitur cura pecuniam.\u201d Meanwhile, Biddy, having consulted a slate that hung in the corner, told us our reckoning came to 8s. 7d. \u201cEight shillings and seven pence!\u201d cried Strap, \u201c\u2019tis impossible! you must be mistaken, young woman.\u201d \u201cReckon again, child,\u201d says her father, very deliberately; \u201cperhaps you have miscounted.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed,\u201d replied she, \u201cI know my business better.\u201d I could contain my indignation no longer, but said it was an unconscionable bill, and demanded to know the particulars; upon which the old man got up, muttering, \u201cAy, ay, let us see the particulars\u2014that\u2019s but reasonable.\u201d And, taking pen, ink, and paper, wrote the following items:\nTo bread and beer\t0 6\nTo a fowl and sausages\t2 6\nTo four bottles of quadrim\t2 0\nTo fire and tobacco\t0 7\nTo lodging\t2 0\nTo breakfast\t1 0\n\t\u2014\u2014\n\t8 7\n\nAs he had not the appearance of a common publican, and had raised a sort of veneration in me by his demeanour the preceding night, it was not in my power to upbraid him as he deserved; therefore, I contented myself with saying I was sure he did not learn to be an extortioner from Horace. He answered, I was but a young man and did not know the world, or I would not tax him with extortion, whose only aim was to live contentus parvo, and keep off importuna pauperies. My fellow traveller could not so easily put up with this imposition; but swore he should either take one-third of the money or go without. While we were engaged in this dispute, I perceived the daughter go out, and, conjecturing the occasion, immediately paid the exorbitant demand, which was no sooner done than Biddy returned with two stout fellows, who came in on pretence of taking their morning draught, but in reality to frighten us into compliance. Just as we departed, Strap, who was half-distracted on account of this piece of expense, went up to the schoolmaster, and, grinning in his face, pronounced with great emphasis\u2014\u201cSemper avarus eget.\u201d To which the pedant replied, with a malicious smile\u2014\u201cAnimum rege, qui, nisi paret, imperat.\u201d\nCHAPTER XI\n\nWe descry the Waggon\u2014get into it\u2014arrive at an inn\u2014our Fellow Travellers described\u2014a Mistake is committed by Strap, which produces strange things\n\nWe travelled half-a-mile without exchanging one word; my thoughts being engrossed by the knavery of the world, to which I must be daily exposed, and the contemplation of my finances, which began sensibly to diminish. At length, Strap, who could hold no longer, addressed me thus: \u201cWell, fools and their money are soon parted. If my advice had been taken, that old skin-flint should have been d\u2014n\u2019d before he had got more than the third of his demand. \u2019Tis a sure sign you came easily by your money, when you squander it away in this manner. Ah! God help you, how many bristly beards must I have mowed before I earned four shillings and threepence-halfpenny, which is all thrown to the dogs! How many days have I sat weaving hair till my toes were numbed by the cold, my fingers cramped, and my nose as blue as the sign of the periwig that hung over the door! What the devil was you afraid of? I would have engaged to box with any one of those fellows who came in for a guinea\u2014I\u2019m sure\u2014I have beat stouter men than either of them.\u201d And, indeed, my companion would have fought anybody when his life was in no danger; but he had a mortal aversion to fire-arms and all instruments of death. In order to appease him, I assured him no part of this extraordinary expense should fall upon his shoulders; at which declaration he was affronted, and told me he would have me to know that, although he was a poor barber\u2019s boy, yet he had a soul to spend big money with the best squire of the land.\n\nHaving walked all day at a great pace, without halting for a refreshment, we descried, toward the evening, to our inexpressible joy, the waggon about a quarter of a mile before us; and, by that time we reached it, were both of us so weary that I verily believe it would have been impracticable for us to have walked one mile farther. We, therefore, bargained with the driver, whose name was Joey, to give us a cast to the next stage for a shilling; at which place we should meet the master of the waggon, with whom we might agree for the rest of the journey.\n\nAccordingly the convenience stopped, and Joey having placed the ladder, Strap (being loaded with our baggage) mounted first; but, just as he was getting in, a tremendous voice assailed his ears in these words: \u201cGod\u2019s fury! there shall no passengers come here.\u201d The poor shaver was so disconcerted at this exclamation, which both he and I imagined proceeded from the mouth of a giant, that he descended with great velocity and a countenance as white as paper. Joey, perceiving our astonishment, called, with an arch sneer, \u201cWaunds, coptain, whay woant yau sooffer the poor waggoneer to meake a penny? Coom, coom, young man, get oop, get oop, never moind the coptain; I\u2019se not afeard of the coptain.\u201d\n\nThis was not encouragement sufficient to Strap, who could not be prevailed upon to venture up again; upon which I attempted, though not without a quaking heart, when I heard the same voice muttering, like distant thunder\u2014\u201cHell and the devil confound me, if I don\u2019t make you smart for this!\u201d However, I crept in, and by accident got an empty place in the straw, which I immediately took possession of, without being able to discern the faces of my fellow-travellers in the dark. Strap following, with the knapsack on his back, chanced to take the other side, and, by a jolt of the carriage, pitched directly upon the stomach of the captain, who bellowed out, in a most dreadful manner, \u201cBlood and thunder! where\u2019s my sword?\u201d At these words my frighted comrade started up, and, at one spring, bounced against me with such force that I thought he was the supposed son of Anak, who intended to press me to death. In the meantime a female voice cried, \u201cBless me! what is the matter, my dear?\u201d \u201cThe matter,\u201d replied the captain, \u201cd\u2014n my blood! my guts are squeezed into a pancake by that Scotchman\u2019s hump.\u201d Strap, trembling all the while at my back, asked him pardon, and laid the blame of what had happened upon the jolting of the waggon; and the woman who spoke before went on: \u201cAy, ay, my dear, it is our own fault; we may thank ourselves for all the inconveniences we meet with. I thank God I never travelled so before. I am sure if my lady or Sir John were to know where we are they would not sleep this night for vexation. I wish to God we had writ for the chariot; I know we shall never be forgiven.\u201d \u201cCome, come, my dear,\u201d replied the captain, \u201cit don\u2019t signify fretting now; we shall laugh it over as a frolic; I hope you will not suffer in your health. I shall make my lord very merry with our adventures in this diligence.\u201d\n\nThe discourse gave me such a high notion of the captain and his lady that I durst not venture to join in the conversation; but immediately after another female voice began: \u201cSome people give themselves a great many needless airs; better folks than any here have travelled in waggons before now. Some of us have rode in coaches and chariots, with three footmen behind them, without making so much fuss about it. What then? We are now all upon a footing; therefore let us be sociable and merry. What do you say, Isaac? Is not this a good motion, you doting rogue? Speak, you old cent per cent fornicator? What desperate debt are you thinking of? What mortgage are you planning? Well, Isaac, positively you shall never gain my favour till you turn over a new leaf, grow honest, and live like a gentleman. In the meantime give me a kiss, you old fumbler.\u201d These words, accompanied with a hearty smack, enlivened the person to whom they were addressed to such a degree that he cried, in transport, though with a faltering voice, \u201cAh! you wanton baggage\u2014upon my credit, you are a waggish girl\u2014he, he, he!\u201d This laugh introduced a fit of coughing, which almost suffocated the poor usurer (such we afterwards found was the profession of this our fellow-traveller).\n\nAbout this time I fell asleep, and enjoyed a comfortable nap till such time as we arrived at the inn where we put up. Here, having alighted from the waggon, I had an opportunity of viewing the passengers in order as they entered. The first who appeared was a brisk, airy girl, about twenty years old, with a silver-laced hat on her head instead of a cap, a blue stuff riding-suit, trimmed with silver very much tarnished, and a whip in her hand. After her came, limping, an old man, with a worsted nightcap buttoned under his chin, and a broad-brimmed hat slouched over it, an old rusty blue cloak tied about his neck, under which appeared a brown surtout, that covered a threadbare coat and waistcoat, and, as he afterwards discerned, a dirty flannel jacket. His eyes were hollow, bleared, and gummy; his face was shrivelled into a thousand wrinkles, his gums were destitute of teeth, his nose sharp and drooping, his chin peaked and prominent, so that, when he mumped or spoke, they approached one another like a pair of nutcrackers: he supported himself on an ivory-headed cane and his whole figure was a just emblem of winter, famine, and avarice. But how was I surprised, when I beheld the formidable captain in the shape of a little thin creature, about the age of forty, with a long withered visage, very much resembling that of a baboon, through the upper part of which two little gray eyes peeped: he wore his own hair in a queue that reached to his rump, which immoderate length, I suppose, was the occasion of a baldness that appeared on the crown of his head when he deigned to take off his hat, which was very much of the size and cock of Pistol\u2019s.\n\nHaving laid aside his great-coat, I could not help admiring the extraordinary make of this man of war: he was about five feet and three inches high, sixteen inches of which went to his face and long scraggy neck: his thighs were about six inches in length, his legs resembling spindles or drumsticks, five feet and a half, and his body, which put me in mind of extension without substance, engrossed the remainder: so that on the whole, he appeared like a spider or grasshopper erect, and was almost a vox et praeterea nihil. His dress consisted of a frock of what is called bearskin, the skirts of which were about half a foot long, an hussar waistcoat, scarlet breeches reaching half way down his thighs, worsted stockings rolled up almost to his groin, and shoes with wooden heels at least two inches high; he carried a sword very near as long as himself in one hand, and with the other conducted his lady, who seemed to be a woman of his own age, and still retained some remains of an agreeable person, but so ridiculously affected, that, had I not been a novice in the world, I might have easily perceived in her the deplorable vanity and second-hand airs of a lady\u2019s woman.\n\nWe were all assembled in the kitchen, when Captain Weazel (for that was his name) desired a room with a fire for himself and spouse, and told the landlord they would up by themselves. The innkeeper replied that he could not afford them a room by themselves; and as for supping, he had prepared victuals for the passengers in the waggon, without respect of persons, but if he could prevail on the rest to let him have his choice in a separate manner, he should be very well pleased. This was no sooner said than all of us declared against the proposal, and Miss Jenny (our other female passenger), observed that, if Captain Weazel and his lady had a mind to sup by themselves, they might wait until we should have done. At this hint the captain put on a martial frown, and looked very big, without speaking; while his yokefellow, with a disdainful toss of her nose, muttered something about \u201cCreature!\u201d which Miss Jenny overhearing, stepped up to her, saying, \u201cNone of your names, good Mrs. Abigail. Creature, quotha\u2014I\u2019ll assure you no such creature as you neither\u2014no ten-pound sneaker\u2014no quality-coupler.\u201d Here the captain interposed, with a \u201cD\u2014e, madam, what do you mean by that?\u201d \u201cD\u2014n you sir, who are you?\u201d replied Miss Jenny, \u201cwho made you a captain, you pitiful, trencher-scraping, pimping curler? \u2019Sdeath! the army is come to a fine pass, when such fellows as you get commissions. What, I suppose you think I don\u2019t know you? Egad, you and your helpmate are well met\u2014a cast-off mistress and a bald valet-de-chambre are well yoked together.\u201d \u201cBlood and wounds!\u201d cried Weazel, \u201cd\u2019ye question the honour of my wife, madam? Hell and d-ion! No man in England durst say so much\u2014I would flay him, carbonado him! Fury and destruction! I would have his liver for my supper.\u201d So saying, he drew his sword and flourished with it, to the great terror of Strap; while Miss Jenny, snapping her fingers, told him she did not value his resentment a louse.\n\nIn the midst of this quarrel the master of the waggon alighted, who, understanding the cause of the disturbance, and fearing the captain and his lady would take umbrage and leave his carriage, was at great pains to have everything made up, which he at last accomplished, and we sat down to supper altogether. At bedtime we were shown to our apartments; the old usurer, Strap, and I, to one room; the captain, his wife, and Miss Jenny, to another. About midnight, my companion\u2019s bowels being disordered, he got up, in order to go backward, but in his return, mistaking one door for another, entered Weazel\u2019s chamber, and without any hesitation went to bed to his wife, who was fast asleep, the captain being at another end of the room groping for some empty vessel, in lieu of his own chamberpot, which was leaky: as he did not perceive Strap coming in, he went towards his own bed, after having found a convenience; but no sooner did he feel a rough head, covered with a cotton nightcap, than it came into his mind that he had mistaken Miss Jenny\u2019s bed instead of his own, and that the head he felt was that of some gallant, with whom she had made an assignation. Full of his conjecture, and scandalised at the prostitution of his apartment, he snatched up the vessel he had just before filled, and emptied it at once on the astonished barber and his own wife, who waking at that instant, broke forth into lamentable cries, which not only alarmed the husband beyond measure, but frighted poor Strap almost out of his senses; for he verily believed himself bewitched, especially when the incensed captain seized him by the throat, with a volley of oaths, asking him how he durst have the presumption to attempt the chastity of his wife. Poor Strap was so amazed and confounded, that he could say nothing but\u2014\u201cI take God to witness she\u2019s a virgin for me.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weazel, enraged to find herself in such a pickle through the precipitation of her husband, arose in her shift, and with the heel of her shoe which she found by the bedside, belaboured the captain\u2019s bald pate till he roared \u201cMurder.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll teach you to empty your stinkpots on me,\u201d cried she, \u201cyou pitiful hop-o\u2019-my-thumb coxcomb. What, I warrant you\u2019re jealous, you man of lath. Was it for this I condescended to take you to my bed, you poor, withered, sapless twig?\u201d\n\nThe noise occasioned by this adventure had brought the master of the waggon and me to the door, where we overheard all that passed with great satisfaction. In the meantime we were alarmed with the cry of \u201cRape! Murder! Rape!\u201d which Jenny pronounced with great vociferation. \u201cOh! You vile abominable old villain,\u201d said she, \u201cwould you rob me of my virtue? But I\u2019ll be revenged of you, you old goat! I will! Help! for heaven\u2019s sake! help! I shall be ravished! ruined! help!\u201d Some servants of the inn, hearing this cry, came running upstairs with lights, and such weapons as chance afforded; when we beheld a very diverting scene. In one corner stood the poor captain shivering in his shirt, which was all torn to rags: with a woeful visage, scratched all over by his wife, who had by this time wrapped the counterpane about her, and sat sobbing on the side of her bed. At the other end lay the old usurer, sprawling on Miss Jenny\u2019s bed, with his flannel jacket over his shirt, and his tawny meagre limbs exposed to the air; while she held him fast by the two ears, and loaded him with execrations. When he asked what was the matter, she affected to weep, told us she was afraid that wicked rogue had ruined her in her sleep, and bade us take notice of what we saw, for she intended to make use of our evidence against him. The poor wretch looked like one more dead than alive, and begged to be released; a favour which he had no sooner obtained than he protested she was no woman, but a devil incarnate\u2014that she had first seduced his flesh to rebel, and then betrayed him. \u201cYes, cockatrice,\u201d continued he, \u201cyou know you laid this snare for me\u2014but you shan\u2019t succeed\u2014for I will hang myself before you shall get a farthing of me.\u201d So saying, he crawled to his own bed, groaning all the way. We then advanced to the Captain, who told us, \u201cGentlemen, here has been a d\u2014d mistake; but I\u2019ll be revenged on him who was the cause of it. That Scotchman who carries the knapsack shall not breathe this vital air another day, if my name be Weazel. My dear, I ask you ten thousand pardons; you are sensible, I could mean no harm to you.\u201d \u201cI know not what you meant,\u201d replied she, sighing, \u201cbut I know I have got enough to send me to my grave.\u201d At length they were reconciled. The wife was complimented with a share of Miss Jenny\u2019s bed (her own being overflowed), and the master of the waggon invited Weazel to sleep the remaining part of the night with him. I retired to mine, where I found Strap mortally afraid, he having stolen away in the dark while the captain and his lady were at loggerheads.\nCHAPTER XII\n\nCaptain Weazel challenges Strap, who declines the Combat\u2014an Affair between the Captain and me\u2014the Usurer is fain to give Miss Jenny five Guineas for a Release\u2014we are in Danger of losing a Meal\u2014the Behaviour of Weazel, Jenny, and Joey, on that Occasion\u2014an Account of Captain Weazel and his Lady\u2014the Captain\u2019s Courage tried\u2014Isaac\u2019s mirth at the Captain\u2019s Expense\n\nNext morning I agreed to give the master of the waggon ten shillings for my passage to London, provided Strap should be allowed to take my place when I should be disposed to walk. At the same time I desired him to appease the incensed captain, who had entered the kitchen with a drawn sword in his hand, and threatened with many oaths to sacrifice the villain who attempted to violate his bed; but it was to no purpose for the master to explain the mistake, and assure him of the poor lad\u2019s innocence, who stood trembling behind me all the while: the more submission that appeared in Strap, the more implacable seemed the resentment of Weazel, who swore he must either fight him or he would instantly put him to death. I was extremely provoked at this insolence, and told him, it could not be supposed that a poor barber lad would engage a man of the sword at his own weapon; but I was persuaded he would wrestle or box with him. To which proposal Strap immediately gave assent, by saying, \u201che would box with him for a guinea.\u201d Weazel replied with a look of disdain, that it was beneath any gentleman of his character to fight like a porter, or even to put himself on a footing, in any respect, with such a fellow as Strap. \u201cOdds bodikins!\u201d cries Joey, \u201csure, coptain, yaw would not commit moorder! Here\u2019s a poor lad that is willing to make atonement for his offence; and an that woan\u2019t satisfie yaw, offers to fight yaw fairly. And yaw woan\u2019t box, I dare say, he will coodgel with yaw. Woan\u2019t yaw, my lad?\u201d Strap, after some hesitation, answered, \u201cYes, yes, I\u2019ll cudgel with him.\u201d But this expedient being also rejected by the captain, I began to smell his character, and, tipping Strap the wink, told the captain that I had always heard it said, the person who receives a challenge should have the choice of the weapons; this therefore being the rule in point of honour, I would venture to promise on the head of my companion, that he would even fight Captain Weazel at sharps; but it should be with such sharps as Strap was best acquainted with, namely, razors. At my mentioning razors: I could perceive the captain\u2019s colour change while Strap, pulling me by the sleeve, whispered with great eagerness: \u201cNo, no, no; for the love of God, don\u2019t make any such bargain.\u201d At length, Weazel, recovering himself, turned towards me, and with a ferocious countenance asked, \u201cWho the devil are you? Will you fight me?\u201d With these words, putting himself in a posture, I was grievously alarmed at seeing the point of a sword within half a foot of my breast; and, springing to one side, snatched up a spit that stood in the chimney-corner, with which I kept my formidable adversary at bay, who made a great many half-longes, skipping backward at every push, till at last I pinned him up in a corner, to the no small diversion of the company. While he was in this situation his wife entered, and, seeing her husband in these dangerous circumstances, uttered a dreadful scream: in this emergency, Weazel demanded a cessation, which was immediately granted; and at last was contented with the submission of Strap, who, falling on his knees before him, protested the innocence of his intention, and asked pardon for the mistake he had committed. This affair being ended without bloodshed, we went to breakfast, but missed two of our company, namely, Miss Jenny and the usurer. As for the first, Mrs. Weazel informed us, that she had kept her awake all night with her groans; and that when she rose in the morning, Miss Jenny was so much indisposed that she could not proceed on her journey. At that instant, a message came from her to the master of the waggon, who immediately went into her chamber, followed by us all. She told him in a lamentable tone, that she was afraid of a miscarriage, owing to the fright she received last night from the brutality of Isaac; and, as the event was uncertain, desired the usurer might be detained to answer for the consequence. Accordingly, this ancient Tarquin was found in the waggon, whither he had retired to avoid the shame of last night\u2019s disgrace, and brought by force into her presence. He no sooner appeared than she began to weep and sigh most piteously, and told us, if she died, she would leave her blood upon the head of that ravisher. Poor Isaac turned up his eyes and hands to heaven, prayed that God would deliver him from the machinations of that Jezebel; and assured us, with tears in his eyes, that his being found in bed with her was the result of her own invitation. The waggoner, understanding the case, advised Isaac to make it up, by giving her a sum of money: to which advice he replied with great vehemence, \u201cA sum of money!\u2014a halter for the cockatrice!\u201d \u201cOh! \u2019tis very well,\u201d said Miss Jenny; \u201cI see it is in vain to attempt that flinty heart of his by fair means. Joey, be so good as to go to the justice, and tell him there is a sick person here, who wants to see him on an affair of consequence.\u201d At the name of justice Isaac trembled, and bidding Joey stay, asked with a quavering voice, \u201cWhat she would have? She told him that, as he had not perpetrated his wicked purpose, she would be satisfied with a small matter. And though the damage she might sustain in her health might be irreparable, she would give him a release for a hundred guineas.\u201d \u201cA hundred guineas!\u201d cried he in an ecstacy, \u201ca hundred furies! Where should a poor old wretch like me have a hundred guineas? If I had so much money, d\u2019ya think I should be found travelling in a waggon, at this season of the year?\u201d \u201cCome, come,\u201d replied Jenny, \u201cnone of your miserly artifice here. You think I don\u2019t know Isaac Rapine, the money-broker, in the Minories. Ah! you old rogue! many a pawn have you had of me and my acquaintance, which was never redeemed.\u201d Isaac, finding it was in vain to disguise himself, offered twenty shillings for a discharge, which she absolutely refused under fifty pounds: at last, however, she was brought down to five, which he paid with great reluctancy, rather than be prosecuted for a rape. After which accommodation, the sick person made a shift to get into the waggon, and we set forward in great tranquillity; Strap being accommodated with Joey\u2019s horse, the driver himself choosing to walk. The morning and forenoon we were entertained with an account of the valour of Captain Weazel, who told us he had once knocked down a soldier that made game of him; tweaked a drawer by the nose, who found fault with his picking his teeth with a fork, at another time; and that he had moreover challenged a cheesemonger, who had the presumption to be his rival: for the truth of which exploits he appealed to his wife. She confirmed whatever he said, and observed, \u201cThe last affair happened that very day on which I received a love-letter from Squire Gobble, and don\u2019t you remember, my dear, I was prodigiously sick that very night with eating ortolans, when my Lord Diddle took notice of my complexion\u2019s being altered, and my lady was so alarmed that she had well nigh fainted?\u201d \u201cYes, my dear,\u201d replied the captain, \u201cyou know my lord said to me, with a sneer, \u2018Billy, Mrs. Weazel is certainly breeding.\u2019 And I answered cavalierly, \u2018My lord, I wish I could return the compliment.\u2019 Upon which the whole company broke out into an immoderate fit of laughter; and my lord, who loves a repartee dearly, came round and bussed me.\u201d We travelled in this manner five days, without interruption or meeting anything worth notice: Miss Jenny, who soon recovered her spirits, entertaining us every day with diverting songs, of which she could sing a great number; and rallying her own gallant, who, notwithstanding, would never be reconciled to her. On the sixth day, while we were about to sit down to dinner, the innkeeper came and told us, that three gentlemen, just arrived, had ordered the victuals to be carried to their apartment, although he had informed them that they were bespoke by the passengers in the waggon. To which information they had replied, \u201cthe passengers in the waggon might be d\u2014d, their betters must be served before them; they supposed it would be no hardship on such travellers to dine upon bread and cheese for one day.\u201d This was a terrible disappointment to us all; and we laid our heads together how to remedy it; when Miss Jenny observed that Captain Weazel, being by profession a soldier, ought in this case to protect and prevent us from being insulted. But the Captain excused himself, saying, he would not for all the world be known to have travelled in a waggon! swearing at the same time, that could he appear with honour, they should eat his sword sooner than his provision. Upon this declaration, Miss Jenny, snatching his weapon, drew it, and ran immediately into the kitchen, where she threatened to put the cook to death if he did not send the victuals into our chamber immediately. The noise she made brought the three strangers down, one of whom no sooner perceived her than he cried, \u201cHa! Jenny Ramper! what the devil brought thee hither?\u201d \u201cMy dear Jack Rattle!\u201d replied she, running into his arms, \u201cis it you? Then Weazel may go to hell for a dinner\u2014I shall dine with you.\u201d\n\nThey consented to this proposal with a great deal of joy; and we were on the point of being reduced to a very uncomfortable meal, when Joey, understanding the whole affair, entered the kitchen with a pitchfork in his hand, and swore he would be the death of any man who should pretend to seize the victuals prepared for the waggon. The menace had like to have produced fatal consequences; the three strangers drawing their swords, and being joined by their servants, and we ranging ourselves on the side of Joey; when the landlord, interposing, offered to part with his own dinner to keep the peace, which was accepted by the strangers; and we sat down at table without any further molestation. In the afternoon, I chose to walk along with Joey, and Strap took my place. Having entered into a conversation with this driver, I soon found him to be a merry, facetious, good-natured fellow, and withal very arch; he informed me, that Miss Jenny was a common girl upon the town, who, falling into company with a recruiting officer, he carried her down in the stage coach from London to Newcastle, where he had been arrested for debt, and was now in prison; upon which she was fain to return to her former way of life, by this conveyance. He told me likewise, that one of the gentleman\u2019s servants, who were left at the inn, having accidentally seen Weazel, immediately knew him, and acquainted Joey with some particulars of his character. That he had served my Lord Frizzle in quality of valet-de-chambre many years, while he lived separate from his lady; but, upon their reconciliation, she expressly insisted upon Weazel\u2019s being turned off, as well as the woman he kept: when his lordship, to get rid of them both with a good grace, proposed that he should marry his Mistress, and he would procure a commission for him in the army: this expedient was agreed to, and Weazel is now, by his lordship\u2019s interest, ensigned in \u2014\u2019s regiment. I found he and I had the same sentiments with regard to Weazel\u2019s courage, which he resolved to put to the trial, by alarming the passengers with the cry of a \u2018highwayman!\u2019 as soon as a horseman should appear.\n\nThis scheme we put in practice, towards the dusk, when we descried a man on horseback approaching us. Joey had no sooner intimated to the people in the waggon, that he was afraid we should be all robbed than a general consternation arose: Strap jumped out of the waggon, and hid himself behind a hedge. The usurer put forth ejaculations, and made a rustling among the straw, which made us conjecture he had hid something under it. Mrs. Weazel, wringing her hands uttered lamentable cries: and the captain, to our great amazement, began to snore; but this artifice did not succeed; for Miss Jenny, shaking him by the shoulder, bawled out, \u201cSdeath! captain, is this a time to snore, when we are going to be robbed? Get up for shame, and behave like a soldier and man of honour!\u201d Weazel pretended to be in a great passion for being disturbed, and swore he would have his nap out if all the highwaymen in England surrounded him. \u201cD\u2014n my blood! what are you afraid of?\u201d continued he; at the same time trembling with such agitation that the whole carriage shook. This singular piece of behaviour incensed Miss Ramper so much that she cried, \u201cD\u2014n your pitiful soul, you are as arrant a poltroon, as ever was drummed out of a regiment. Stop the waggon, Joey\u2014let me out, and by G\u2014d, if I have rhetoric enough, the thief shall not only take your purse, but your skin also.\u201d So saying she leaped out with great agility. By this time the horseman came up and happened to be a gentleman\u2019s servant well known to Joey, who communicated the scheme, and desired him to carry it on a little further, by going into the waggon, and questioning those within. The stranger, consenting for the sake of diversion, approached it, and in a terrible tone demanded, \u201cWho have we got here?\u201d Isaac replied, with a lamentable voice, \u201cHere\u2019s a poor miserable sinner, who has got a small family to maintain, and nothing in the world wherewithal, but these fifteen shillings which if you rob me of we must all starve together.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s that sobbing in the other corner?\u201d said the supposed highwayman. \u201cA poor unfortunate woman,\u201d answered Mrs. Weazle, \u201cupon whom I beg you, for Christ\u2019s sake, to have compassion.\u201d \u201cAre you maid or wife,\u201d said he. \u201cWife, to my sorrow,\u201d said she. \u201cWho, or where is your husband?\u201d continued he. \u201cMy husband,\u201d replied Mrs. Weazel, \u201cis an officer in the army and was left sick at the last inn where we dined.\u201d \u201cYou must be mistaken, madam,\u201d said he, \u201cfor I myself saw him get into the waggon this afternoon. But pray what smell is that? Sure your lapdog has befouled himself; let me catch hold of the nasty cur, I\u2019ll teach him better manners.\u201d Here he laid hold of one of Weazel\u2019s legs, and pulled him out from under his wife\u2019s petticoat, where he had concealed himself. The poor trembling captain, being detected in his inglorious situation, rubbed his eyes, and affecting to wake out of sleep, cried, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cThe matter is not much,\u201d answered the horseman; \u201cI only called in to inquire after your health, and so adieu, most noble captain.\u201d He clapped spurs to his horse, and was out of sight in a moment.\n\nIt was some time before Weazel could recollect himself, but at length reassuming the big look, he said, \u201cD\u2014n the fellow! why did he ride away before I had time to ask him how his lord and lady do? Don\u2019t you remember Tom, my dear?\u201d addressing himself to his wife. \u201cYes,\u201d replied she, \u201cI think I do remember something of the fellow, but you know I seldom converse with people of his station.\u201d \u201cHey-day!\u201d cried Joey, \u201cdo yaw knaw the young mon, coptain?\u201d \u201cKnow him,\u201d said Weazel, \u201cmany a time has he filled a glass of Burgundy for me, at my Lord Trippett\u2019s table.\u201d \u201cAnd what may his name be, coptain?\u201d said Joey. \u201cHis name!\u2014his name,\u201d replied Weazel, \u201cis Tom Rinser.\u201d \u201cWaunds,\u201d cried Joey, \u201ca has changed his own neame then! for I\u2019se lay a wager he was christened John Trotter.\u201d This observation raised a laugh against the captain, who seemed very much disconcerted; when Isaac broke silence, and said, \u201cIt is no matter who or what he was, since he has not proved the robber we suspected, and we ought to bless God for our narrow escape.\u201d \u201cBless God,\u201d said Weazel, \u201cbless the devil! for what? Had he been a highwayman, I should have eaten his blood, body, and guts, before he had robbed me, or any one in this diligence.\u201d \u201cHa, ha, ha,\u201d cried Miss Jenny, \u201cI believe you will eat all you kill, indeed, captain.\u201d The usurer was so well pleased at the event of this adventure, that he could not refrain from being severe, and took notice that Captain Weazel seemed to be a good Christian, for he had armed himself with patience and resignation, instead of carnal weapons; and worked out his salvation with fear and trembling. This piece of satire occasioned a great deal of mirth at Weazel\u2019s expense, who muttered a great many oaths, and threatened to cut Isaac\u2019s throat. The usurer, taking hold of this menace, said, \u201cGentlemen and ladies, I take you all to witness, that my life is in danger from this bloody-minded officer; I\u2019ll have him bound over to the peace.\u201d This second sneer produced another laugh against him, and he remained crestfallen during the remaining part of our journey.\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nStrap and I are terrified by an Apparition\u2014Strap\u2019s Conjecture\u2014the Mystery explained by Joey\u2014we arrive in London\u2014our Dress and Appearance described\u2014we are insulted in the Street\u2014an Adventure in an Alehouse\u2014we are imposed upon by a waggish Footman\u2014set to rights by a Tobacconist\u2014take Lodgings\u2014dive for a Dinner\u2014an Accident at our Ordinary\n\nWe arrived at our inn, supped, and went to bed; but Strap\u2019s distemper continuing, he was obliged to rise in the middle of the night, and taking the candle in his hand, which he had left burning for the purpose, he went down to the house of office, whence in a short time he returned in a great hurry, with his hair standing on end, and a look betokening horror and astonishment. Without speaking a word, he set down the light and jumped into bed behind me, where he lay and trembled with great violence. When I asked him what was the matter, he replied, with a broken accent, \u201cGod have mercy on us! I have seen the devil!\u201d Though my prejudice was not quite so strong as his, I was not a little alarmed at this exclamation, and much more so when I heard the sound of bells approaching our chamber, and felt my bedfellow cling close to me, uttering these words, \u201cChrist have mercy upon us; there he comes!\u201d At that instance a monstrous overgrown raven entered our chamber, with bells at his feet, and made directly towards our bed. As this creature is reckoned in our country a common vehicle for the devil and witches to play their pranks in, I verily believed we were haunted; and, in a violent fright, shrank under the bedclothes. This terrible apparition leaped upon the bed, and after giving us several severe dabs with its beak through the blankets, hopped away, and vanished. Strap and I recommended ourselves to the protection of heaven with great devotion, and, when we no longer heard the noise, ventured to peep up and take breath. But we had not been long freed from this phantom, when another appeared, that had well nigh deprived us both of our senses. We perceived an old man enter the room, with a long white beard that reached to his middle; there was a certain wild peculiarity in his eyes and countenance that did not savour of this world; and his dress consisted of a brown stuff coat, buttoned behind and at the wrists, with an odd-fashioned cap of the same stuff upon his head. I was so amazed that I had not power to move my eyes from such a ghastly object, but lay motionless and saw him come straight up to me: when he reached the bed, he wrung his hands, and cried, with a voice that did not seem to belong to a human creature, \u201cWhere is Ralph?\u201d I made no reply: upon which he repeated, in an accent still more preternatural, \u201cWhere is Ralpho?\u201d He had no sooner pronounced these words than I heard the sound of the bells at a distance; which the apparition, having listened to, tripped away, and left me almost petrified with fear. It was a good while before I could recover myself so far as to speak; and, when at length I turned to Strap, I found him in a fit, which, however, did not last long. When he came to himself, I asked his opinion of what had happened; and he assured me that the first must certainly be the soul of some person damned, which appeared by the chain about his legs (for his fears had magnified the creature to the bigness of a horse, and the sound of small morice-bells to the clanking of massy chains). As for the old man, he took it to be the spirit of somebody murdered long ago in this place, which had power granted to forment the assassin in the shape of a raven, and that Ralpho was the name of the said murderer. Although I had not much faith in this interpretation, I was too much troubled to enjoy any sleep: and in all my future adventures never passed a night so ill.\n\nIn the morning Strap imparted the whole affair to Joey, who, after an immoderate fit of laughter, explained the matter, by telling him that the old man was the landlord\u2019s father, who had been an idiot some years, and diverted himself with a tame raven, which, it seems, had hopped away from his apartment in the night, and induced him to follow it to our chamber, where he had inquired after it under the name of Ralpho.\n\nNothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of our journey, which continued six or seven days longer: at length we entered the great city, and lodged all night at the inn where the waggon put up. Next morning all the passengers parted different ways, while my companion and I sallied out to inquire for the member of parliament, to whom I had a letter of recommendation from Mr. Crab. As we had discharged our lodging at the inn, Strap took up our baggage and, marched behind me in the street with the knapsack on his back, as usual, so that we made a very whimsical appearance. I had dressed myself to the greatest advantage; that is, put on a clean ruffled shirt, and my best thread stockings: my hair (which was of the deepest red) hung down upon my shoulders, as lank and straight as a pound of candles; and the skirts of my coat reached to the middle of my leg; my waistcoat and breeches were of the same piece, and cut in the same taste; and my hat very much resembled a barber\u2019s basin, in the shallowness of the crown and narrowness of the brim. Strap was habited in a much less awkward manner: but a short crop-eared wig, that very much resembled Scrub\u2019s in the play, and the knapsack on his back, added to what is called a queer phiz, occasioned by a long chin, a hook nose, and high cheek bones, rendered him, on the whole, a very fit subject of mirth and pleasantry. As he walked along, Strap, at my desire, inquired of a carman, whom we met, whereabouts Mr. Cringer lived: and was answered by a stare, accompanied with the word \u201cAnan!\u201d Upon which I came up, in order to explain the question, but had the misfortune to be unintelligible likewise, the carman damning us for a lousy Scotch guard, whipping his horses with a \u201cGee ho!\u201d which nettled me to the quick, and roused the indignation of Strap so far that, after the fellow was gone a good way, he told me he would fight him for a farthing.\n\nWhile we were deliberating upon what was to be done, a hackney coachman, driving softly along, and perceiving us standing by the kennel, came up close to us, and calling, \u201cA coach, master!\u201d by a dexterous management of the reins made his horses stumble in the wet, and bedaub us all over with mud. After which exploit he drove on, applauding himself with a hearty laugh, in which several people joined, to my great mortification; but one, more compassionate than the rest, seeing us strangers, advised me to go into an alehouse, and dry myself. I thanked him for his advice, which I immediately complied with; and, going into the house he pointed out, called for a pot of beer, and sat down by a fire in the public room where we cleaned ourselves as well as we could. In the meantime, a wag, who sat in a box, smoking his pipe, understanding, by our dialect, that we were from Scotland, came up to me and, with a grave countenance asked how long I had been caught. As I did not know the meaning of this question, I made no answer; and he went on, saying it could not be a great while, for my tail was not yet cut; at the same time taking hold of my hair, and tipping the wink to the rest of the company, who seemed highly entertained with his wit. I was incensed at this usage, but afraid of resenting it, because I happened to be in a strange place, and perceived the person who spoke to me was a brawny fellow, for whom I thought myself by no means a match. However, Strap, having either more courage or less caution, could not put up with the insults I suffered, but told him in a peremptory tone, \u201cHe was an uncivil fellow for making so free with his betters.\u201d Then the wit going toward him, asked him what he had got in his knapsack? \u201cIs it oatmeal or brimstone, Sawney?\u201d said he, seizing him by the chin, which he shook, to the inexpressible diversion of all present. My companion, feeling himself assaulted in such an opprobrious manner, disengaged himself in a trice, and lent his antagonist such a box on the ear as made him stagger to the other side of the room; and, in a moment, a ring was formed for the combatants. Seeing Strap beginning to strip, and my blood being heated with indignation, which banished all other thoughts, I undressed myself to the skin in an instant, and declared, that as the affront that occasioned the quarrel was offered to me, I would fight it out myself; upon which one or two cried out, \u201cThat\u2019s a brave Scotch boy; you shall have fair play.\u201d His assurance gave me fresh spirits, and, going up to my adversary, who by his pale countenance did not seem much inclined to the battle, I struck him so hard on the stomach, that he reeled over a bench, and fell to the ground. Then I attempted to keep him down, in order to improve my success, according to the manner of my own country, but was restrained by the spectators, one of whom endeavoured to raise up my opponent, but in vain; for he protested he would not fight, for he was not quite recovered of a late illness. I was very well pleased with this excuse, and immediately dressed myself, having acquired the good opinion of the company for my bravery, as well as of my comrade Strap, who shook me by the hand, and wished me joy of the victory.\n\nAfter having drunk our pot, and dried our clothes, we inquired of the landlord if he knew Mr. Cringer, the member of parliament, and were amazed at his replying in the negative; for we imagined he must be altogether as conspicuous here as in the borough he represented; but he told us we might possibly hear of him as we passed along. We betook ourselves therefore to the street, where seeing a footman standing at the door, we made up to him, and asked if he knew where our patron lived? This member of the particoloured fraternity, surveying us both very minutely, said he knew Mr. Cringer very well, and bade us turn down the first street on our left, then turn to the right, and then to the left again, after which perambulation we would observe a lane, through which we must pass, and at the other end we should find an alley that leads to another street, where we should see the sign of the Thistle and Three Pedlars, and there he lodged. We thanked him for his information, and went forwards, Strap telling me, that he knew this person to be an honest friendly man by his countenance, before he opened his mouth; in which opinion I acquiesced, ascribing his good manners to the company he daily saw in the house where he served.\n\nWe followed his directions punctually, in turning to the left, and to the right, and to the left again; but instead of seeing a lane before us, found ourselves at the side of the river, a circumstance that perplexed us not a little; and my fellow-traveller ventured to pronounce, that we had certainly missed our way. By this time we were pretty much fatigued with our walk, and not knowing how to proceed, I went into a small snuff-shop hard by, encouraged by the sign of the Highlander, where I found, to my inexpressible satisfaction, the shopkeeper was my countryman. He was no sooner informed of our peregrination, and the directions we had received from the footman, than he informed us we had been imposed upon, telling us, Mr. Cringer lived in the other end of the town and that it would be to no purpose for us to go thither to-day, for by that time he was gone to the House. I then asked, if he could recommend us a lodging. He really gave us a line to one of his acquaintance who kept a chandler\u2019s shop not far from St. Martin\u2019s Lane; there we hired a bed-room, up two pair of stairs, at the rate of two shillings per week, so very small, that when the bed was let down, we were obliged to carry out every other piece of furniture that belonged to the apartment, and use the bedstead by way of chairs. About dinner-time, our landlord asked how we proposed to live? to which interrogation we answered, that we would be directed by him. \u201cWell, then,\u201d says he, \u201cthere are two ways of eating in this town for people of your condition\u2014the one more creditable and expensive than the other: the first is to dine at an eating-house frequented by well-dressed people only; and the other is called diving, practised by those who are either obliged or inclined to live frugally.\u201d I gave him to understand that, provided the last was not infamous, it would suit much better with our circumstances than the other. \u201cInfamous!\u201d cried he, \u201cnot at all; there are many creditable people, rich people, ay, and fine people, that dive every day. I have seen many a pretty gentleman with a laced waistcoat dine in that manner very comfortably for three pence halfpenny, and go afterwards to the coffee-house, where he made a figure with the best lord in the land; but your own eyes shall bear witness\u2014I will go along with you to-day and introduce you.\u201d\n\nHe accordingly conducted us to a certain lane, where stopping, he bade us observe him, and do as he did, and, walking a few paces, dived into a cellar and disappeared in an instant. I followed his example, and descending very successfully, found myself in the middle of a cook\u2019s shop, almost suffocated with the steams of boiled beef, and surrounded by a company of hackney coachmen, chairmen, draymen, and a few footmen out of place or on board-wages; who sat eating shin of beef, tripe, cow-heel, or sausages, at separate boards, covered with cloths which turned my stomach. While I stood in amaze, undetermined whether to sit down or walk upwards again, Strap, in his descent, missing one of the stops, tumbled headlong into this infernal ordinary, and overturned the cook as she carried a porringer of soup to one of the guests. In her fall, she dashed the whole mess against the legs of a drummer belonging to the foot-guards, who happened to be in her way, and scalded him so miserably, that he started up, and danced up and down, uttering a volley of execrations that made my hair stand on end.\n\nWhile he entertained the company in this manner, with an eloquence peculiar to himself, the cook got up, and after a hearty curse on the poor author of this mischance, who lay under the table with a woful countenance, emptied a salt-cellar in her hand, and, stripping down the patient\u2019s stocking, which brought the skin along with it, applied the contents to the sore. This poultice was scarce laid on, when the drummer, who had begun to abate of his exclamations, broke forth into such a hideous yell as made the whole company tremble, then, seizing a pewter pint pot that stood by him, squeezed the sides of it together, as if it had been made of pliant leather, grinding his teeth at the same time with a most horrible grin. Guessing the cause of this violent transport, I bade the woman wash off the salt, and bathe the part with oil, which she did, and procured him immediate ease. But here another difficulty occurred, which was no other than the landlady\u2019s insisting on his paying for the pot he had rendered useless. He said, he would pay for nothing but what he had eaten, and bade her be thankful for his moderation, or else he would prosecute her for damages. Strap, foreseeing the whole affair would lie at his door, promised to satisfy the cook, and called for a dram of gin to treat the drummer, which entirely appeased him, and composed all animosities. After this accommodation, our landlord and we sat down at a board, and dined upon shin of beef most deliciously; our reckoning amounting to twopence halfpenny each, bread and small beer included.\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nWe visit Strap\u2019s friend\u2014a description of him\u2014his advice\u2014we go to Mr. Cringer\u2019s house\u2014are denied admittance\u2014an Accident befalls Strap\u2014his behaviour thereupon\u2014an extraordinary adventure occurs, in the course of which I lose all my money\n\nIn the afternoon my companion proposed to call at his friend\u2019s house, which, we were informed, was in the neighbourhood, whither we accordingly went, and were so lucky as to find him at home. This gentleman, who had come from Scotland three or four years before, kept a school in town, where he taught the Latin, French, and Italian languages; but what he chiefly professed was the pronunciation of the English tongue, after a method more speedy and uncommon than any practised heretofore, and, indeed, if his scholars spoke like their master, the latter part of his undertaking was certainly performed to a tittle: for although I could easily understand every word of what I had heard hitherto since I entered England, three parts in four of his dialect were as unintelligible to me as if he had spoken in Arabic or Irish. He was a middle-sized man, and stooped very much, though not above the age of forty; his face was frightfully pitted with the small-pox, and his mouth extended from ear to ear. He was dressed in a night-gown of plaid, fastened about his middle with a sergeant\u2019s old sash, and a tie-periwig with a foretop three inches high, in the fashion of King Charles the Second\u2019s reign.\n\nAfter he had received Strap, who was related to him, very courteously, he inquired of him who I was; and being informed, he took me by the hand, telling me he was at school with my father. When he understood my situation, he assured me that he would do me all the service in his power, both by his advice and otherwise, and while he spoke these words eyed me with great attention, walking round me several times, and muttering, \u201cOh, dear! Oh, dear! fat a saight is here!\u201d I soon guessed the reason of his ejaculation, and said, \u201cI suppose, sir, you are not pleased with my dress.\u201d \u201cDress,\u201d answered he, \u201cyou may caal it fat you please in your country, but I vow to Gad \u2019tis a masquerade here. No Christian will admit such a figure into his house. Upon my conscience, I wonder the dogs did not hunt you. Did you pass through St. James\u2019s market? Bless my eyesaight! you are like a cousin-german of an ourangoutang.\u201d I began to be a little serious at this discourse, and asked him, if he thought I should obtain entrance to-morrow at the house of Mr. Cringer, on whom I chiefly depended for an introduction into business? \u201cMr. Cringer, Mr. Cringer,\u201d replied he, scratching his cheek, \u201cmay be a very honest gentleman\u2014I know nothing to the contrary; but is your sole dependence upon him? Who recommended you to him?\u201d I pulled out Mr. Crab\u2019s letter, and told him the foundation of my hopes, at which he stared at me, and repeated \u201cOh dear! Oh dear!\u201d I began to conceive bad omens from this behaviour of his, and begged he would assist me with his advice, which he promised to give very frankly; and as a specimen, directed us to a periwig warehouse in the neighbourhood, in order to be accommodated; laying strong injunctions on me not to appear before Mr. Cringer till I had parted with my carroty locks, which, he said, were sufficient to beget an antipathy against me in all mankind. And as we were going to pursue this advice, he called me back and bade me be sure to deliver my letter into Mr. Cringer\u2019s own hand.\n\nAs we walked along, Strap triumphed greatly in our reception with his friend, who, it seems, had assured him he would in a day or two provide for him with some good master; \u201cI and now,\u201d says he, \u201cI you will see how I will fit you with a wig. There\u2019s ne\u2019er a barber in London (and that\u2019s a bold word) can palm a rotten caul, or a pennyweight of dead hair, upon me.\u201d And, indeed, this zealous adherent did wrangle so long with the merchant, that he was desired twenty times to leave the shop, and see if he could get one cheaper elsewhere. At length I made choice (if a good handsome bob), for which I paid ten shillings, and returned to our lodging, where Strap in a moment rid me of that hair which had given the schoolmaster so much offence.\n\nWe got up next day betimes, having been informed that Mr. Cringer gave audience by candle-light to all his dependents, he himself being obliged to attend the levee of my Lord Terrier at break of day, because his lordship made one at the minister\u2019s between eight and nine o\u2019clock. When we came to Mr. Cringer\u2019s door, Strap, to give me all instance of his politeness, ran to the knocker, which he employed so loud and so long, that he alarmed the whole street; and a window opening in the second story of the next house, a vessel was discharged upon him so successfully, that the poor barber was wet to the skin, while I, being luckily at some distance, escaped the unsavoury deluge. In the meantime, a footman opening the door, and seeing nobody in the street but us, asked, with a stern countenance, if it was I who made such a noise, and what I wanted. I told him I had business with his master, whom I desired to see. Upon which he slapped the door in my face, telling me I must learn better manners before I could have access to his master. Vexed at this disappointment, I turned my resentment against Strap, whom I sharply reprimanded for his presumption; but he, not in the least regarding what I said, wrung the wet out of his periwig, and lifting up a large stone, flung it with such force against the street door of that house from whence he had been bedewed, that the lock giving way, it flew wide open, and he took to his heels, leaving me to follow him as I could. Indeed, there was no time for deliberation; I therefore pursued him with all the speed I could exert, until we found ourselves about the dawn in a street we did not know. Here, as we wandered along gaping about, a very decent sort of a man, passing by me, stopped of a sudden and took up something, which having examined, he turned and presented to me with these words: \u201cSir, you have dropped half-a-crown.\u201d I was not a little surprised at this instance of honesty, and told him it did not belong to me; but he bade me recollect, and see if all my money was safe; upon which I pulled out my purse, for I had bought one since I came to town, and, reckoning my money in my hand, which was now reduced to five guineas seven shillings and twopence, assured him I had lost nothing. \u201cWell, then, says he, so much the better; this is a godsend, and as you two were present when I picked it up, you are entitled to equal shares with me.\u201d I was astonished at these words, and looked upon this person to be a prodigy of integrity, but absolutely refused to take any part of the sum. \u201cCome, gentlemen,\u201d said he, \u201cyou are too modest\u2014I see you are strangers, but you shall give me leave to treat you with a whet this cold raw morning.\u201d I would have declined the invitation, but Strap whispered to me that the gentleman would be affronted, and I complied. \u201cWhere shall we go?\u201d said the stranger; \u201cI am quite ignorant of this part of the town.\u201d I informed him that we were in the same situation; upon which he proposed to go into the first public-house we should find open; and as we walked together, he began in this manner: \u201cI find by your tongues you are from Scotland, gentlemen; my grandmother by the father\u2019s side was of your country, and I am so prepossessed in its favour, that I never meet a Scotchman but my heart warms. The Scots are very brave people. There is scarce a great family in the kingdom that cannot boast of some exploits performed by its ancestors many hundred years ago. There\u2019s your Douglasses, Gordons, Campbells, Hamiltons. We have no such ancient families here in England. Then you are all very well educated. I have known a pedlar talk in Greek and Hebrew as well as if they had been his mother-tongue. And for honesty\u2014I once had a servant, his name was Gregor Macgregor, I would have trusted him with untold gold.\u201d\n\nThis eulogium of my native country gained my affections so strongly, that I believe I could have gone to death to serve the author; and Strap\u2019s eyes swam in tears. At length, as we passed through a dark narrow lane, we perceived a public-house, which we entered, and found a man sitting by the fire, smoking a pipe, with a pint of purl before him. Our new acquaintance asked us if ever we had drunk egg-flip? To which question we answering in the negative, he assured us of a regale, and ordered a quart to be prepared, calling for pipes and tobacco at the same time. We found this composition very palateable, and drank heartily; the conversation, which was introduced by the gentleman, turning upon the snares that young inexperienced people are exposed to in this metropolis. He described a thousand cheats that are daily practised upon the ignorant and unwary, and warned us of them with so much good nature and concern, that we blessed the opportunity which threw us in his way. After we had put the can about for some time, our new friend began to yawn, telling us he had been up all night with a sick person; and proposed we should have recourse to some diversion to keep him awake. \u201cSuppose,\u201d said he, \u201cwe should take a hand at whist for pastime. But let me see: that won\u2019t do, there\u2019s only three of us; and I cannot play at any other game. The truth is, I seldom or never play, but out of complaisance, or at such a time as this, when I am in danger of falling asleep.\u201d\n\nAlthough I was not much inclined to gaming, I felt no aversion to pass an hour or two at cards with a friend; and knowing that Strap understood as much of the matter as I, made no scruple of saying, \u201cI wish we could find a fourth hand.\u201d While we were in this perplexity the person whom we found in the house at our entrance, overhearing our discourse, took the pipe from his mouth very gravely, and accosted us thus: \u201cGentlemen, my pipe is out, you see,\u201d shaking the ashes into the fire, \u201cand rather than you should be balked, I don\u2019t care if I take a hand with you for a trifle\u2014but remember I won\u2019t play for anything of consequence.\u201d We accepted his proffer with pleasure. Having cut for partners, it fell to my lot to play with him against our friend and Strap, for threepence a game. We were so successful, that in a short time I was half-a-crown gainer; when the gentleman whom we had met in the street observing he had no luck to-day, proposed to leave off, or change partners. By this time I was inflamed with my good fortune and the expectation of improving it, as I perceived the two strangers played but indifferently; therefore I voted for giving him his revenge: and cutting again, Strap and I, to our mutual satisfaction, happened to be partners. My good fortune attended me still, and in less than an hour we had got thirty shillings of their money, for as they lost they grew the keener, and doubled stakes every time. At last the inconstant goddess began to veer about, and we were very soon stripped of all our gains, and about forty shillings of our own money. This loss mortified me extremely, and had a visible effect on the muscles of Strap\u2019s face, which lengthened apace; but our antagonists perceiving our condition, kindly permitted us to retrieve our loss, and console ourselves with a new acquisition. Then my companion wisely suggested it was time to be gone; upon which the person who had joined us in the house began to curse the cards, and muttered that we were indebted to fortune only for what we had got, no part of our success being owing to our good play. This insinuation nettled me so much that I challenged him to a game at piquet for a crown: and he was with difficulty persuaded to accept the invitation. This contest ended in less than an hour to my inexpressible affliction, who lost every shilling of my own money, Strap absolutely refusing to supply me with a sixpence.\n\nThe gentleman at whose request we had come in, perceiving by my disconsolate looks the situation of my heart, which well nigh burst with grief and resentment, when the other stranger got up, and went away with my money, began in this manner:\u2014\u201cI am truly afflicted at your bad luck, and would willingly repair it, were it in my power. But what in the name of goodness could provoke you to tempt your fate so long? It is always a maxim with gamesters to pursue success as far us it will go, and to stop whenever fortune shifts about. You are a young man, and your passions are too impetuous; you must learn to govern them better. However, there is no experience like that which is bought; you will be the better for this the longest day you have to live. As for the fellow who has got your money, I don\u2019t half like him. Did not you see me tip you the wink to leave off in time?\u201d I answered, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d continued he; \u201cyou was too eager to mind anything but the game. But, harkee,\u201d said he in a whisper, \u201care you satisfied of that young man\u2019s honesty? His looks are a little suspicious\u2014but I may be mistaken; he made a great many grimaces while he stood behind you, this is a very wicked town.\u201d I told him I was very well convinced of my comrade\u2019s integrity and, that the grimaces he mentioned were doubtless owing to his anxiety of my loss. \u201cOh ho! if that be the case, I ask his pardon. Landlord, see what\u2019s to pay.\u201d The reckoning amounted to eighteenpence, which, having discharged, the gentleman shook us both by the hand, and, saying he should be very glad to see us again, departed.\nCHAPTER XV\n\nStrap moralises\u2014presents his purse to me\u2014we inform our landlord of our misfortune\u2014he unravels the mystery\u2014I present myself to Cringer\u2014he recommends and turns me over to Mr. Staytape\u2014I become acquainted with a fellow dependent, who explains the character of Cringer and Staytape\u2014and informs me of the method to be pursued at the Navy Office and Surgeons\u2019 Hall\u2014Strap is employed\n\nIn our way to our lodging, after a profound silence on both sides, Strap, with a hideous groan, observed that we had brought our pigs to a fine market. To this observation I made no reply, and he went on: \u201cGod send us well out of this place; we have not been in London eight and forty hours, and I believe we have met with eight and forty thousand misfortunes. We have been jeered, reproached, buffeted, and at last stript of our money; and I suppose by and bye we shall be stript of our skins. Indeed as to the money part of it, that was owing to our own folly.\u2014Solomon says, \u2018Bray a fool in a mortar, and he will never be wise.\u2019 Ah! God help us, an ounce of prudence is worth a pound of gold.\u201d This was no time for him to tamper with my disposition, already mad with my loss, and inflamed with resentment against him for having refused me a little money to attempt to retrieve it. I therefore turned towards him with a stern countenance, and asked, who he called fool? Being altogether unaccustomed to such looks from me, he stood still, and stared in my face for some time; then, with some confusion, uttered, \u201cFool! I called nobody fool but myself; I am sure I am the greatest fool of the two, for being so much concerned at other people\u2019s misfortunes; but \u2018Nemo omnibus horis sapit\u2019\u2014that\u2019s all, that\u2019s all.\u201d Upon which a silence ensued, which brought us to our lodging, where I threw myself upon the bed in an agony of despair, resolved to perish rather than apply to my companion, or any other body, for relief; but Strap, who knew my temper, and whose heart bled within him for my distress, after some pause came to the bedside, and, putting a leathern purse into my hand, burst into tears, crying, \u201cI know what you think, but I scorn your thought. There\u2019s all I have in the world, take it, and I\u2019ll perhaps get more for you before that be done. If not, I\u2019ll beg for you, steal for you, go through the wide world with you, and stay with you; for though I be a poor cobbler\u2019s son, I am no scout.\u201d I was so much touched with the generous passion of this poor creature, that I could not refrain from weeping also, and we mingled our tears together for some time. Upon examining the purse, I found in it two half-guineas and half-a-crown, which I would have returned to him, saying, he knew better than I how to manage it, but he, absolutely refused my proposal and told me it was more reasonable and decent that he should depend upon me, who was a gentleman, than that I should be controlled by him.\n\nAfter this friendly contest was over, and our minds more at ease, we informed our landlord of what had happened to us, taking care to conceal the extremity to which we were reduced. He no sooner heard the story, than he assured us we had been grievously imposed upon by a couple of sharpers, who were associates; and that this polite, honest, friendly, humane person, who had treated us so civilly, was no other than a rascally money-dropper, who made it his business to decoy strangers in that manner to one of his own haunts, where an accomplice or two were always waiting to assist in pillaging the prey he had run down. Here the good man recounted a great many stories of people who has been seduced, cheated, pilfered, beat\u2014nay, even murdered by such villains. I was confounded at the artifice and wickedness of mankind; and Strap, lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, prayed that God would deliver him from such scenes of iniquity, for surely the devil had set up his throne in London. Our landlord being curious to know what reception we had met with at Mr. Cringer\u2019s, we acquainted him with the particulars, at which he shook his head, and told us we had not gone the right way to work; that there was nothing to be done with a member of parliament without a bribe; that the servant was commonly infected with the master\u2019s disease, and expected to be paid for his work, as well as his betters. He therefore advised me to give the footman a shilling the next time I should desire admittance to my patron, or else I should scarce find an opportunity to deliver my letter. Accordingly, next morning, when the door was opened, I slipped a shilling into his hand, and told him I had a letter for his master. I found the good effect of my liberality; for the fellow let me in immediately, and, taking the letter out of my hand, desired me to wait in a kind of passage for an answer. In this place I continued standing for three-quarters-of-an-hour, during which time I saw a great many young fellows whom I formerly knew in Scotland pass and repass, with an air of familiarity, in their way to and from the audience-chamber; while I was fain to stand shivering in the cold, and turn my back to them that they might not perceive the lowness of my condition. At length, Mr. Cringer came out to see a young gentleman to the door, who was no other than Squire Gawky, dressed in a very gay suit of clothes; at parting Mr. Cringer shook him by the hand and told him he hoped to have the pleasure of his company at dinner. Then turning about towards me, asked what were my commands? When he understood I was the person who had brought the letter from Mr. Crab, he affected to recollect my name, which, however, he pretended he could not do till he had consulted the letter again; to save him the trouble, I told him my name was Random. Upon which he went on, \u201cAy, ay, Random, Random, Random\u2014I think I remember the name:\u201d and very well he might, for this very individual, Mr. Cringer, had many a time rode before my grandfather\u2019s cloak-bag, in quality of a footman. \u201cWell,\u201d says he, \u201cyou propose to go on board a man-of-war as surgeon\u2019s mate.\u201d I replied by a low bow. \u201cI believe it will be a difficult matter,\u201d continued he, \u201cto procure a warrant, there being already such a swarm of Scotch surgeons at the Navy Office, in expectation of the next vacancy, that the commissioners are afraid of being torn to pieces, and have actually applied for a guard to protect them. However, some ships will soon be put in commission, and then we shall see what\u2019s to be done.\u201d So saying, he left me, exceedingly mortified at the different reception Mr. Gawky and I had met with from this upstart, proud, mean member, who, I imagined, would have been glad of an opportunity to be grateful for the obligations he owed to my family.\n\nAt my return, I was surprised with the agreeable news of Strap\u2019s being employed, on the recommendation of his friend, the schoolmaster, by a periwig-maker in the neighbourhood, who allowed him five shillings per week besides bed and board. I continued to dance attendance every other morning at the levee of Mr. Cringer, during a fortnight; in which time I became acquainted with a young fellow of my own country and profession, who also depended on the member\u2019s interest, but was treated with much more respect than I, both by the servants and master, and often admitted into a parlour, where there was a fire for the convenience of the better sort of those who waited for him. Thither I was never permitted to penetrate, on account of my appearance, which was not at all fashionable; but was obliged to stand blowing my fingers in a cold lobby, and take the first opportunity of Mr. Cringer\u2019s going to the door to speak with him.\n\nOne day, while I enjoyed this occasion a person was introduced, whom Mr. Cringer no sooner saw, than, running towards him, he saluted him with a low bow to the very ground, and afterwards shaking him by the hand with great heartiness and familiarity, called him his good friend, and asked very kindly after Mrs. Staytape and the young ladies; then, after a whisper, which continued some minutes, wherein I overheard the word \u2018honour\u2019 repeated several times with great emphasis, Mr. Cringer introduced me to this gentleman, as to a person whose advice and assistance I might depend upon; and having given me his direction, followed me to the door, where he told me I need not give myself the trouble to call at his house any more, for Mr. Staytape would do my business. At that instant my fellow-dependent, coming out after me, overheard the discourse of Mr. Cringer, and, making up to me in the street, accosted me very civilly: this address I looked upon as no small honour, considering the figure he made, for he was dressed in a blue frock with a button, a green silk waistcoat, trimmed with gold, black velvet breeches, white silk stockings, silver buckles, a gold-laced hat, a spencer-wig, and a silver-hilted hanger, with a fine clouded can in his hand. \u201cI perceive,\u201d says he, \u201cyou are but lately come from Scotland; pray what may your business with Mr. Cringer be? I suppose it is no secret and I may possibly give you some advice that will be serviceable, for I have been surgeon\u2019s second mate on board of a seventy-gun ship, and consequently know a good deal of the world.\u201d\n\nI made no scruple to disclose my situation, which, when he had learned, he shook his head, and told me he had been pretty much, in the same circumstances about a year ago: that he had relied on Cringer\u2019s promises, until his money (which was considerable) as well as his credit, was quite exhausted; and when he wrote to his relations for a fresh supply, instead of money he received nothing but reproaches, and the epithets of idle, debauched fellow. That after he had waited at the Navy Office many months for a warrant to no purpose, he was fain to pawn some of his clothes, which raised a small sum wherewith he bribed the secretary, who soon procured a warrant for him, notwithstanding he had affirmed the same day, that there was not one vacancy. That he had gone on board, where he remained nine months, at the end of which the ship was put out of commission, and he said the company were to be paid off in Broad Street the very next day. That relations being reconciled to him, had charged him to pay his devoirs regularly to Mr. Cringer, who had informed them by letter that his interest alone had procured the warrant; in obedience to which command he came to his levee every morning; as I saw, though he looked upon him to be a very pitiful scoundrel. In conclusion, he asked me if I had yet passed at Surgeons\u2019 Hall? To which question I answered, I did not so much as know it was necessary. \u201cNecessary:\u201d cried he, \u201cOh then I find I must instruct you: come along with me, and I\u2019ll give you information about that matter.\u201d So Saying, he carried me into an ale-house, where I called for some beer, and bread and cheese, on which we breakfasted. While we sat in this place, he told me I must first go to the Navy Office, and write to the Board, desiring them to order a letter for me to Surgeon\u2019s Hall, that I might be examined, touching my skill in surgery. That the surgeons, after having examined me, would give me my qualification sealed up in form of a letter directed to the commissioners, which qualification I must deliver to the secretary of the Board, who would open it in my presence, and read the contents; after which I must employ my interest to be provided for as soon as possible. That the expense of his qualification for second mate of a third-rate, amounted to thirteen shillings, exclusive of the warrant, which cost him half-a-guinea and half-a-crown, besides a present to the secretary, which consisted of a three-pound twelve piece. This calculation was like a thunderbolt to me, whose whole fortune did not amount to twelve shillings. I accordingly made him acquainted with this part of my distress, after having thanked him for his information and advice. He condoled me on this occasion; but bade me be of good cheer, for he had conceived a friendship for me, and would make all things easy. He was ran out at present, but to-morrow or next day, he was certain of receiving a considerable sum; of which he would lend me what would be sufficient to answer my exigencies. This frank declaration pleased me so much, that I pulled out my purse, and emptied it before him, begging him to take what he pleased for pocket-expense, until he should receive his own money. With a good deal of pressing, he was prevailed upon to take five shillings telling me that he might have what money he wanted at any time for the trouble of going into the city; but as he had met with me, he would defer his going thither till tomorrow, when I should go along with him, and he would put me in the way of acting for myself, without a servile dependence on that rascal Cringer, much less on the tailor to whom he heard him turn me over. \u201cHow!\u201d cried I, \u201cis Mr. Staytape a tailor.\u201d \u201cNo less, I assure you,\u201d answered he, \u201cand, I confess, more likely to serve you than the member; for, provided you can entertain him with politics and conundrums, you may have credit with him for as many and as rich clothes as you please.\u201d I told him, I was utterly ignorant of both, and so incensed at Cringer\u2019s usage, that I would never set foot within his door again.\n\nAfter a good deal more conversation, my new acquaintance and I parted, having made an appointment to meet next day at the same place; in order to set out for the city. I went immediately to Strap and related everything which had happened, but he did not at all approve of my being so forward to lend money to a stranger, especially as we had already been so much imposed upon by appearances. \u201cHowever,\u201d said he, \u201cif you are sure he is a Scotchman, I believe you are safe.\u201d\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nMy new acquaintance breaks an appointment\u2014I proceed, by myself, to the Navy Office\u2014address me to a person there, who assists me with advice\u2014write to the Board, they grant me a letter to the Surgeons at the Hall\u2014am informed of the beau\u2019s name and character\u2014find him\u2014he makes me his confidant in an amour\u2014desires me to pawn my linen for his occasions\u2014recover what I lent him\u2014some curious observations on Strap on that occasion\u2014his vanity.\n\nIn the morning I rose and went to the place of rendezvous, where I waited two hours in vain, and was so exasperated against him for breaking his appointment, that I set out for the city by myself, in hope of finding the villain, and being revenged on him for his breach of promise. At length I found myself at the Navy Office, which I entered, and saw crowds of young fellows walking below, many of whom made no better appearance than myself. I consulted the physiognomy of each, and at last made up to one whose countenance I liked, and asked, if he could instruct me in the form of the letter which was to be sent to the Board to obtain an order for examination? He answered me in broad Scotch, that he would show me the copy of what he had writ for himself, by direction of another who know the form, and accordingly pulled it out of his pocket for my perusal; and told me that, if I was expeditious, I might send it into the Board before dinner, for they did no business in the afternoon. He then went with me to coffee-house hard by, where I wrote the letter, which was immediately delivered to the messenger, who told me I might expect an order to-morrow about the same time.\n\nHaving transacted this piece of business, my mind was a good deal composed; and as I had met with so much civility from the stranger, I desired further acquaintance with him, fully resolved, however, not to be deceived by him so much to my prejudice as I had been by the beau. He agreed to dine with me at the cook\u2019s shop which I frequented; and on our way thither carried me to \u2019Change, where I was in hopes of finding Mr. Jackson (for that was the name of the person who had broke his appointment), I sought him there to no purpose, and on our way towards the other end of the town imparted to my companion his behaviour towards me; upon which he gave me to understand, that he was no stranger to the name of Bean Jackson (so he was called at the Navy Office), although he did not know him personally; that he had the character of a good-natured careless fellow, who made no scruple of borrowing from any that would lend; that most people who knew him believed he had a good principle at bottom, but his extravagance was such, he would probably never have it in his power to manifest the honesty of his intention. This made me sweat for my five shillings, which I nevertheless did not altogether despair of recovering, provided I could find out the debtor.\n\nThis young man likewise added another circumstance of Squire Jackson\u2019s history, which was, that being destitute of all means to equip himself for sea, when he received his last warrant, he had been recommended to a person who lent him a little money, after he had signed a will entitling that person to lift his wages when they should become due, as also to inherit his effects in case of his death. That he was still under the tutorage and direction of that gentleman, who advanced him small sums from time to time upon this security, at the rate of fifty per cent. But at present his credit was very low, because his funds would do little more than pay what he had already received, this moderate interest included. After the stranger (whose name was Thompson) had entertained me with this account of Jackson, he informed me that he himself had passed for third mate of a third-rate, about four months ago; since which time he had constantly attended at the Navy Office, in hope of a warrant, having been assured from the beginning, both by a Scotch member, and one of the commissioners to whom the member recommended him, that he should be put into the first vacancy; notwithstanding which promise, he had the mortification to see six or seven appointed in the same station almost every week\u2014that now being utterly impoverished, his sole hope consisted in the promise of a friend lately come to town, to lend him a small matter, for a present to the secretary; without which he was persuaded he might wait a thousand years to no purpose. I conceived a mighty liking for this young fellow, which (I believe) proceeded from the similitude of our fortunes. We spent the whole day together; and as he lived at Wapping I desired him to take a share of my bed.\n\nNext day we returned to the Navy Office, where, after being called before the Board, and questioned about the place of my nativity and education, they ordered a letter to be made out for me, which, upon paying half-a-crown to the clerk, I received, and delivered into the hands of the clerk at Surgeons\u2019 Hall, together with a shilling for his trouble in registering my name. By this time my whole stock was diminished to two shillings, and I saw not the least prospect of relief, even for present subsistence, much less to enable me to pay the fees at Surgeons\u2019 Hall for my examination, which would come on in a fortnight. In this state of perplexity, I consulted Strap, who assured me he would pawn everything he had in the world, even to his razors, before I should want: but this expedient I absolutely rejected, telling him, I would a thousand times rather list for a soldier, of which I had some thoughts, than be any longer a burden to him. At the word soldier, he grew pale as death, and begged on his knees I would think no more of that scheme. \u201cGod preserve us all in our right wits!\u201d cried he, \u201cwould you turn soldier, and perhaps be sent abroad against the Spaniards, where you must stand and be shot at like a woodcock? Heaven keep cold lead out of my carcase, and let me die in a bed like a Christian, as all my forefathers have done. What signifies all earthly riches and honour, if one enjoys not content? and, hereafter, there is no respect of persons. Better be a poor honest barber with a good conscience, and time to repent of my sins upon my death-bed, than be cut off (God bless us!) by a musket-shot, as it were in the very flower of one\u2019s age, in the pursuit of riches and fame. What signify riches, my dear friend? do they not make unto themselves wings and fly away? as the wise man saith. I could also mention many other sayings in contempt of riches, both from the Bible and other good books; but I know you are not very fond of those things, I shall only assure you, that if you take on to be a soldier, I will do the same; and then if we should both be slain, you will not only have your own blood to answer for, but mine also: and peradventure the lives of all those whom we shall kill in battle. Therefore I pray you, consider whether you will sit down contented with small things and share the fruits of my industry in peace, till Providence shall send better tidings; or, by your despair, plunge both our souls and bodies into everlasting perdition, which God of his infinite mercy forbid!\u201d I could not help smiling at this harangue, which was delivered with great earnestness, the tears standing in his eyes all the time, and promised to do nothing of that sort without his consent and concurrence. He was much comforted with this declaration; and told me in a few days he should receive a week\u2019s wages, which should be at my service, but advised me in the meantime to go in quest of Jackson, and recover, if possible, what he had borrowed of me. I accordingly trudged about from one end of the town to the other, for several days, without being able to learn anything certain concerning him: and, one day being extremely hungry, and allured by the steams that regaled my nostrils from a boiling cellar, I went down with an intention to gratify my appetite with a twopennyworth of beef; when to my no small surprise found Mr. Jackson sitting at dinner with a footman. He no sooner perceived me than he got up and shook me by the hands saying, he was glad to see me, for he intended to have called at my lodgings in the afternoon. I was so well pleased at this rencounter and the apologies he made for not keeping his appointment, that I forgot my resentment, and sat down to dinner, with the happy expectation of not only recovering my own money before we should part, but also of reaping the benefit of his promise to lend me wherewithal to pass examination; and this hope my sanguine complexion suggested, though the account Thompson gave me of him ought to have moderated my expectation.\n\nWhen we had feasted sumptuously, he took his leave of the footman, and adjourned with me to an ale-house hard by, where, after shaking me by the hand again, he began thus: \u201cI suppose you think me a sad dog, Mr. Random, and I do confess that appearances are against me. But I dare say you will forgive me when I tell you, my not coming at the time appointed was owing to a peremptory message I received from a certain lady, whom, harkee! (but this is a great secret) I am to marry very soon. You think this strange, perhaps, but it is not less true for all that\u2014a five thousand pounder, I\u2019ll assure you, besides expectations. For my own part, devil take me if I know what any woman can see engaging about me\u2014but a whim, you know\u2014and then one would not balk one\u2019s good fortune. You saw that footman who dined with us\u2014he\u2019s one of the honestest fellows that ever wore livery. You must know it was by his means I was introduced to her, for he made me first acquainted with her woman, who is his mistress\u2014ay, many a crown has he and his sweetheart had of my money\u2014but what of that? things are now brought to a bearing. I have\u2014(come a little this way) I have proposed marriage, and the day is fixed\u2014she\u2019s a charming creature, and writes like an angel! She can repeat all the English tragedies as well as ever a player in Drury Lane!-and, indeed, is so fond of plays, that to be near the stage she has taken lodgings in a court hard by the theatre; but you shall see\u2014you shall see\u2014here\u2019s the last letter she sent me.\u201d With these words, he put it into my hand, and I read (to the best of my remembrance) as follows:\n\n\u2018Dear Kreeter\u2014As you are the animable hopjack of my contemplayshins, your aydear is infernally skimming before my keymerycal fansee, when Murfy sends his puppies to the heys of slipping mortals; and when Febus shines from his merry dying throne; whereupon I shall canseif old time has lost his pinners, as also cubit his harrows, until thou enjoy sweet propose in the loafseek harms of thy very faithfool to commend,\n\nClayrender\n\nWingar Yard, Drury Lane,\nJanuary 12th.\u2019\n\nWhile I was reading, he seemed to be in an ecstasy, rubbing his hands, and bursting out into fits of laughter; at last he caught hold of my hand, and squeezing it, cried, \u201cThere\u2014a style for you! What do you think of this billet-doux?\u201d I answered, \u201cIt might be sblime for aught I knew, for it was altogether above my comprehension.\u201d \u201cOh, ho!\u201d said he, \u201cI believe it is\u2014both tender and sublime; she\u2019s a divine creature! and so doats upon me! Let me see\u2014what shall I do with this money, when I have once got it into my hands? In the first place, I shall do for you. I\u2019m a man of few words\u2014-but say no more that\u2019s determined; whether would you advise me, to purchase some post, by which I may rise in the state, or lay out my wife\u2019s fortune in land, and retire to the country at once?\u201d I gave my opinion without hesitation, that he could not do better than buy an estate and improve; especially since he had already seen so much of the world. Then I launched out into the praises of a country life, as described by the poets whose works I had read. He seemed to relish my advice, but withal told me, that although he had seen a great deal of the world both at land and sea, having cruised three whole months in the Channel, yet he should not be satisfied until he had visited France, which he proposed to do before he should settle; and to carry his wife along with him. I had nothing to object to his proposal; and asked how soon he hoped to be happy. \u201cAs to that,\u201d he replied, \u201cnothing obstructs my happiness but the want of a little ready cash; for you must know, my friend in the city has gone out of town for a week or two, but I unfortunately missed my pay at Broad Street, by being detained too long by the dear charmer\u2014but there will be a recall at Chatham next week, whither the ship\u2019s books are sent, and I have commissioned a friend in that place to receive the money.\u201d \u201cIf that be all,\u201d said I, \u201cthere\u2019s no great harm in deferring your marriage a few days.\u201d \u201cYes, faith, but there is,\u201d said he; \u201cyou don\u2019t know how many rivals I have, who would take all advantages against me. I would not balk the impatience of her passion for the world\u2014the least appearance of coldness or indifference would ruin all; and such offers don\u2019t occur every day.\u201d\n\nI acquiesced in this observation, and inquired how he intended to proceed. At this question he rubbed his chin, and said, \u201cWhy, truly, I must be obliged to some friend or other\u2014do you know nobody that would lend me a small sum for a day or two?\u201d I assured him, I was such an utter stranger in London, that I did not believe I could borrow a guinea if my life depended upon it. \u201cNo!\u201d said he, \u201cthat\u2019s hard\u2014that\u2019s hard! I wish I had anything to pawn\u2014upon my soul, you have got excellent linen (feeling the sleeve of my shirt); how many shirts of that kind have you got?\u201d I answered, \u201cSix ruffled, and six plain.\u201d At which he testified great surprise, and declared that no gentleman ought to have more than four. \u201cHow many d\u2019ye think I have got?\u201d continued he; \u201cbut this and another, as I hope to be saved! and I dare say we shall be able to raise a good sum out of your superfluity: let me see\u2014let me see\u2014each of these shirts is worth sixteen shillings at a moderate computation\u2014now, suppose we pawn them for half-price\u2014eight times eight is sixty-four, that\u2019s three pounds four; that will do\u2014give me your hand.\u201d \u201cSoftly, softly, Mr. Jackson,\u201d said I; \u201cdon\u2019t dispose of my linen without my consent: first pay me the crown you owe me, and then we shall talk of other matters.\u201d He protested that he had not above one shilling in his pocket, but that he would pay me out of the first of the money raised from the shirts. This piece of assurance incensed me so much that I swore I would not part with him until I had received satisfaction for what I had lent him; and as for the shirts, I would not pawn one of them to save him from the gallows.\n\nAt this expression he laughed aloud, and then complained it was very hard that I should refuse him a trifle that would infallibly enable him not only to make his own fortune but mine also. \u201cYou talk of pawning my shirts,\u201d said I; \u201csuppose you should sell this hanger, Mr. Jackson. I believe it would fetch a good round sum.\u201d \u201cNo, hang it!\u201d said he, \u201cI can\u2019t appear decently without my hanger, lest it should go.\u201d However, seeing me inflexible with regard to my linen, he at length unbuckled his hanger, and, showing me the three blue balls, desired me to carry it thither and pawn it for two guineas. This office I would by no means have performed, had I seen any likelihood of having my money otherwise; but not willing, out of a piece of false delicacy, to neglect the only opportunity I should perhaps ever have, I ventured into a pawnbroker\u2019s shop, where I demanded two guineas on the pledge, in the name of Thomas Williams. \u201cTwo guineas!\u201d said the pawnbroker, looking at the hanger; \u201cthis piece of goods has been here several times before for thirty shillings: however, since I believe the gentleman to whom it belongs will redeem it, he shall have what he wants; and accordingly he paid me the money, which I carried to the house where I had left Jackson; and, calling for change, counted out to him seven and thirty shillings, reserving the other five for myself.\u201d After looking at the money some time, he said, \u201cWell! it don\u2019t signify\u2014this won\u2019t do my business; so you may as well take half-a-guinea, or a whole one, as the five shillings you have kept.\u201d I thanked him kindly, but refused to accept of any more than was my due, because I had no prospect of repaying it. Upon which declaration, he stared in my face, and told me, I was excessively raw or I would not talk in that manner. \u201cUpon my word,\u201d cried he, \u201cI have a very bad opinion of a young fellow who won\u2019t borrow of his friend when he is in want\u2014\u2019tis the sign of a sneaking spirit. Come, come, Random, give me back the five shillings, and take this half-guinea, and if ever you are able to pay me, I believe you will: if not, I shall never ask it.\u201d\n\nWhen I reflected upon my present necessity, I suffered myself to be persuaded, and after making my acknowledgments to Mr. Jackson, who offered to treat me with a play, I returned to my lodgings with a much better opinion of this gentleman than I had in the morning; and at night imparted my day\u2019s adventure to Strap, who rejoiced at my good luck, saying, \u201cI told you if he was a Scotchman you was safe enough\u2014and who knows but this marriage may make us all. You have heard, I suppose, as how a countryman of ours, a journeyman baker, ran away with a great lady of this town, and now keeps his coach. I say nothing; but yesterday morning as I was shaving a gentleman at his own house, there was a young lady in the room, and she threw so many sheep\u2019s eyes at a certain person whom I shall not name, that my heart went knock, knock, knock, like a fulling mill, and my hand sh-sh-shook so much that I sliced a piece of skin off the gentleman\u2019s nose; whereby he uttered a deadly oath, and was going to horsewhip me, when she prevented him, and made my peace. Is not a journeyman barber as good as a journeyman baker? The only difference is, the baker uses flour for the belly, and the barber rises it for the head: and as the head is a more noble member than the belly, so is a barber more noble than a baker\u2014for what\u2019s the belly without the head? Besides, I am told, he could neither read nor write; now you know I can do both, and moreover, speak Latin\u2014but I will say no more, for I despise vanity\u2014nothing is more vain than vanity.\u201d With these words, he pulled out of his pocket a wax-candle\u2019s end, which he applied to his forehead; and upon examination, I found had combed his own hair over the toupee of his wig, and was, indeed, in his whole dress, become a very smart shaver. I congratulated him on his prospect with a satirical smile, which he understood very well; and, shaking his head, observed, I had very little faith, but the truth would come to light in spite of my incredulity.\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nI go to Surgeons\u2019 Hall, when I meet Mr. Jackson\u2014am examined\u2014a fierce dispute arises between two of the examiners\u2014Jackson disguises himself to attract respect\u2014irises himself to attract respect\u2014is detected\u2014in hazard of being sent to Bridewell\u2014he treats us at a Tavern\u2014carries us to a Night-house\u2014A troublesome adventure there\u2014we are committed to the Round-house\u2014carried before a Justice\u2014his behaviour\n\nWith the assistance of this faithful adherent, who gave me almost all the money he earned, I preserved my half-guinea entire till the day of examination, when I went with a quaking heart to Surgeons\u2019 Hall, in order to undergo that ceremony. Among a crowd of young fellows who walked in the outward hall, I perceived Mr. Jackson, to whom I immediately went up; and, inquiring into the state of his love affair, understood it was still undetermined, by reason of his friend\u2019s absence, and the delay of the recall at Chatham, which put it out of his power to bring it to a conclusion. I then asked what his business was in this place; he replied, he was resolved to have two strings to his bow, that in case the one failed, he might use the other; and, with this view, he was to pass that night for a higher qualification. At that instant, a young fellow came out from the place of examination, with a pale countenance, his lip quivering, and his looks as wild as if he had seen a ghost. He no sooner appeared, than we all flocked about him with the utmost eagerness to know what reception he had met with; which, after some pause, he described, recounting all the questions they had asked, with the answers he made. In this manner we obliged no less than twelve to recapitulate, which, now the danger was past, they did with pleasure, before it fell to my lot: at length the beadle called my name, with a voice that made me tremble. However, there was no remedy. I was conducted into a large hall, where I saw about a dozen of grim faces sitting at a long table: one of whom bade me come forward, in such an imperious tone, that I was actually for a minute or two bereft of my senses. The first question he put to me was, \u201cWhere was you born?\u201d To which I answered, \u201cIn Scotland.\u201d \u201cIn Scotland,\u201d said he; \u201cI know that very well\u2014we have scarce any other countrymen to examine here\u2014you Scotchmen have overspread us of late as the locusts did Egypt. I ask you in what part of Scotland was you born?\u201d I named the place of my nativity, which he had never heard of; he then proceeded to interrogate me about my age, the town where I served my time, with the term of my apprenticeship; and when I informed him that I served three years only, he fell into a violent passion, swore it was a shame and a scandal to send such raw boys into the world as surgeons; that it was great presumption in me, and an affront upon the English, to pretend sufficient skill in my business, having served so short a time, when every apprentice in England was bound seven years at least: that my friends would have done better if they had made me a weaver or shoemaker; but their pride would have me a gentleman, he supposed, at any rate, and their poverty could not afford the necessary education. This exordium did not at all contribute to the recovery of my spirits; but on the contrary, reduced me to such a situation that I was scarcely able to stand; which being perceived by a plump gentleman who sat opposite to me with a skull before him, he said, Mr. Snarler was too severe upon the young man; and, turning towards me, told me I need not be afraid, for nobody would do me any harm: then, bidding me take time to recollect myself, he examined me, touching the operation of the trepan, and was very well satisfied with my answers. The next person who questioned me was a wag, who began by asking if I had ever seen amputation performed; and I replying in the affirmative, he shook his head and said, \u201cWhat! upon a dead subject, I suppose?\u201d \u201cIf,\u201d continued he, \u201cduring an engagement at sea, a man should be brought to you with his head shot off, how would you behave?\u201d After some hesitation, I owned such a case had never come under my observation, neither did I remember to have seen any method of care proposed for such an accident, in any of the systems of surgery I had perused.\n\nWhether it was owing to the simplicity of my answer, or the archness of the question, I know not, but every member at the board deigned to smile, except Mr. Snarler, who seemed to have very little of the \u2018animal risible\u2019 in his constitution. The facetious member, encouraged by the success of his last joke, went on thus: \u201cSuppose you was called to a patient of a plethoric habit, who has been bruised by a fall, what would you do?\u201d I answered, \u201cI would bleed him immediately.\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d said he, \u201cbefore you had tied up his arm?\u201d But this stroke of wit not answering his expectation, he desired me to advance to the gentleman who sat next him; and who, with a pert air, asked, what method of cure I would follow in wounds of the intestines. I repeated the method of care as it is prescribed by the best chirurgical writers, which he heard to an end, and then said with a supercilious smile, \u201cSo you think with such treatment the patient might recover?\u201d I told him I saw nothing to make me think otherwise. \u201cThat may be,\u201d resumed he; \u201cI won\u2019t answer for your foresight, but did you ever know a case of this kind succeed?\u201d I acknowledged I did not, and was about to tell him I had never seen a wounded intestine; but he stopt me, by saying, with some precipitation, \u201cNor never will! I affirm that all wounds of the intestines, whether great or small, are mortal.\u201d \u201cPardon me, brother,\u201d says the fat gentleman, \u201cthere is very good authority\u2014\u201d Here he was interrupted by the other with\u2014\u201cSir, excuse me, I despise all authority\u2014Nullius in verbo\u2014I stand on my own bottom.\u201d \u201cBut sir, sir,\u201d replied his antagonist, \u201cthe reason of the thing shows\u2014\u201d \u201cA fig for reason,\u201d cries this sufficient member; \u201cI laugh at reason; give me ocular demonstratio.\u201d The corpulent gentleman began to wax warm, and observed, that no man acquainted with the anatomy of the parts would advance such an extravagant assertion. This inuendo enraged the other so much, that he started up, and in a furious tone exclaimed: \u201cWhat, Sir! do you question my knowledge in anatomy?\u201d\n\nBy this time, all the examiners had espoused the opinion of one or other of the disputants, and raised their voices altogether, when the chairman commanded silence, and ordered me to withdraw. In less than a quarter of an hour, I was called in again, received my qualification scaled up, and was ordered to pay five shillings. I laid down my half-guinea upon the table, and stood some time, until one of them bade me begone; to this I replied, \u201cI will when I have got my change:\u201d upon which another threw me five shillings and sixpence, saying, I should not be a true Scotchman if I went away without my change. I was afterwards obliged to give three shillings and sixpence to the beadles, and a shilling to an old woman who swept the hall: this disbursement sank my finances to thirteen-pence halfpenny, with which I was sneaking off, when Jackson, perceiving it, came up to me, and begged I would tarry for him, and he would accompany me to the other end of the town, as soon as his examination should be over. I could not refuse this to a person that was so much my friend; but I was astonished at the change of his dress which was varied in half-an-hour from what I have already described to a very grotesque fashion. His head was covered with an old smoke tie-wig that did not boast one crooked hair, and a slouched hat over it, which would have very well become a chimney-sweeper, or a dustman; his neck was adorned with a black crape, the ends of which he had twisted, and fixed in the button-hole of a shabby greatcoat that wrapped up his whole body; his white silk stockings were converted into black worsted hose: and his countenance was rendered venerable by wrinkles, and a beard of his own painting. When I expressed my surprise at this metamorphosis, he laughed, and told me it was done by the advice and assistance of a friend, who lived over the way, and would certainly produce something very much to his advantage; for it gave him the appearance of age, which never fails of attracting respect. I applauded his sagacity, and waited with impatience for the effects of it. At length he was called in; but whether the oddness of his appearance excited a curiosity more than small in the board, or his behaviour was not suitable to his figure, I know not, he was discovered to be an imposter, and put into the hands of the beadle in order to be sent to Bridewell. So that instead of seeing him come out with a cheerful countenance, and a surgeon\u2019s qualification in his hand, I perceived him led through the outer hall as a prisoner; and was very much alarmed, and anxious to know the occasion; when he called with a lamentable voice, and a piteous aspect to me, and some others who know him, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, gentlemen bear witness that I am the same individual John Jackson who served as surgeon\u2019s second mate on board the Elizabeth, or else I shall go to Bridewell!\u201d\n\nIt would have been impossible for the most austere hermit that ever lived to have refrained from laughing at his appearance and address: we therefore indulged ourselves a good while at his expense, and afterwards pleaded his cause so effectually with the beadle who was gratified with half-a-crown, that the prisoner was dismissed, and in a few moments renewed his former gaiety\u2014swearing, since the board had refused his money, he would spend every shilling before he went to bed, in treating his friends; at the same time inviting us all to favour him with our company. It was now ten o\u2019clock at night, and, as I had a great way to walk through streets that were utterly unknown to me, I was prevailed on to be of their party, in hopes he would afterwards accompany me to my lodgings, according to his promise. He conducted me to his friend\u2019s house, who kept a tavern over the way where we continued drinking punch, until the liquor mounted up to our heads, and made us all extremely frolicsome. I, in particular, was so much elevated, that nothing would serve me but a wench; at which demand Jackson expressed much joy, and assured me I should have my desire. before we parted Accordingly, when he had paid the reckoning, we sallied out, roaring and singing; and were conducted by our leader to a place of nocturnal entertainment, where Mr. Jackson\u2019s dress attracted the assiduities of two or three nymphs, who loaded him with caresses, in return for the arrack punch with which he treated them, till at length sleep began to exert his power over us all, and our conductor called \u201cTo pay.\u201d When the bill was brought, which amounted to twelve shillings, he put his hand in his pocket, but might have saved himself the trouble, for his purse was gone. This accident disconcerted him a good deal at first; but after some recollection, he seized the two ladies who sat by him, one in each hand, and swore if they did not immediately restore his money he would charge a constable with them. The good lady at the bar, seeing what passed, whispered something to the drawer, who went out; and then with great composure, asked what was the matter? Jackson told her he was robbed, and swore if she refused him satisfaction, he would have her and her female friends committed to Bridewell. \u201cRobbed!\u201d cried she, \u201crobbed in my house! Gentlemen and Ladies, I take you all to witness, this person has scandalised my reputation.\u201d At that instant, seeing the constable and watch enter, she proceeded \u201cWhat! you must not only endeavour by your false aspersions to ruin my character, but even commit an assault upon my family! Mr. Constable, I charge you with this uncivil person, who has been guilty of a riot here; I shall take care and bring an action against him for defamation.\u201d\n\nWhile I was reflecting on this melancholy event, which had made me quite sober, one of the ladies, being piqued at some repartee that passed between us, cried, \u201cThey are all concerned!\u201d and desired the constable to take us all into custody; an arrest which was performed instantly, to the utter astonishment and despair of us all, except Jackson, who having been often in such scrapes, was very little concerned, and charged the constable, in his turn, with the landlady and her whole bevy; upon which we were carried altogether prisoners to the round-house, where Jackson after a word of comfort to us, informed the constable of his being robbed, to which he said he would swear next morning before the justice. In a little time the constable, calling Jackson into another room, spoke to him thus: \u201cI perceive that you and your company are strangers, and am very sorry for your being involved in such an ugly business. I have known this woman a great while; she has kept a notorious house in the neighbourhood this many years; and although often complained of as a nuisance, still escapes through her interest with the justices, to whom she and all of her employment pay contribution quarterly for protection. As she charged me with you first, her complaint will have the preference, and she can procure evidence to swear whatsoever she shall please to desire of them; so that, unless you can make it up before morning, you and your companions may think yourselves happily quit for a month\u2019s hard labour in Bridewell. Nay, if she should swear a robbery or an assault against you, you will be committed to Newgate and tried at the next session at the Old Bailey for your life.\u201d This last piece of information had such an effect upon Jackson, that he agreed to make it up, provided his money might be restored. The constable told him, that, instead of retrieving what he had lost, he was pretty certain it would cost him some more before they could come to any composition. But, however, he had compassion on him, and would, if he pleased, sound them about a mutual release. The unfortunate beau thanked him for his friendship, and returning to us, acquainted us with the substance of this dialogue; while the constable, desiring to speak in private with our adversary, carried her into the next room, and pleaded, our cause so effectually, that she condescended to make him umpire: he accordingly proposed an arbitration, to which we gave our assent; and he fined each party in three shillings, to be laid out in a bowl of punch, wherein we drowned all animosities, to the inexpressible joy of my two late acquaintances and me, who had been extremely uneasy ever since Jackson mentioned Bridewell and Newgate. By the time we had finished our bowl\u2014to which, by the bye, I had contributed my last shilling\u2014it was morning, and I proposed to move homeward, when the constable gave me to understand, he could discharge no prisoners but by order of the justice, before whom we must appear. This renewed my chagrin, and I cursed the hour in which I had yielded to Jackson\u2019s invitation.\n\nAbout nine o\u2019clock, we were escorted to the house of a certain justice not many miles distant from Covent Garden, who no sooner saw the constable enter with a train of prisoners at his heels, than he saluted him as follows: \u201cSo Mr. Constable, you are a diligent man. What den of rogues have you been scouring?\u201d Then looking at us, who appeared very much dejected, he continued: \u201cAy, ay, thieves. I see\u2014old offenders; oh, your humble servant, Mrs. Harridan! I suppose these fellows have been taken robbing your house. Yes, yes, here\u2019s an old acquaintance of mine. You have used expedition,\u201d said he to me, \u201cin returning from transportation; but we shall save you that trouble for the future\u2014the surgeons will fetch you from your next transportation, at their expense.\u201d I assured his worship he was mistaken in me, for he had never seen me in his life before. To this declaration he replied, \u201cHow! you impudent rascal, dare you say so to my face? Do you think I am to be imposed upon by that northern accent, which you have assumed? But it shan\u2019t avail you\u2014you shall find me too far north for you. Here, clerk, write this fellow\u2019s mittimus. His name is Patrick Gaghagan.\u201d Here Mr. Jackson interposed, and told him I was a Scotchman lately come to town, descended of a good family, and that my name was Random. The justice looked upon this assertion as an outrage upon his memory, on which he valued himself exceedingly; and strutting up to Jackson, with a fierce countenance, put his hands in his side, and said, \u201cWho are you, sir? Do you give me the lie? Take notice, gentlemen, here\u2019s a fellow who affronts me upon the bench but I\u2019ll lay you fast, sirrah, I will\u2014for notwithstanding your laced jacket, I believe you are a notorious felon.\u201d My friend was so much abashed at this menace, which was thundered out with great vociferation, that he changed colour, and remained speechless. This confusion his worship took for a symptom of guilt, and, to complete the discovery, continued his threats, \u201cNow, I am convinced you are a thief\u2014your face discovers it, you tremble all over, your conscience won\u2019t lie still\u2014you\u2019ll be hanged, sirrah,\u201d raising his voice, \u201cyou\u2019ll be hanged; and happy had it been for the world, as well as for your own miserable soul, if you had been detected, and cut off in the beginning of your career. Come hither, clerk, and take this man\u2019s confession.\u201d I was in an agony of consternation, when the constable, going into another room with his worship, acquainted him with the truth of the story; which having learned, he returned with a smiling countenance, and, addressing himself to us all, said it was always his way to terrify young people when they came before him, that his threats might make a strong impression on their minds, and deter them from engaging in scenes of riot and debauchery, which commonly ended before the judge. Thus, having cloaked his own want of discernment under the disguise of paternal care, we were dismissed, and I found myself as much lightened as if a mountain had been lifted off my breast.\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nI carry my qualification to the Navy Office\u2014the nature of it\u2014the behaviour of the Secretary\u2014Strap\u2019s concern for my absence\u2014a battle betwixt him a blacksmith\u2014the troublesome consequences of it\u2014his harangue to me\u2014his friend the schoolmaster recommends me to a French Apothecary, who entertains me as a journeyman\n\nI would most willingly have gone home to sleep, but was told by my companions, that we must deliver our letters of qualification at the Navy office, before one o\u2019clock. Accordingly, we went thither, and gave them to the secretary, who opened and read them, and I was mightily pleased to find myself qualified for second mate of a third-rate. When he had stuck them all together on a file, one of our company asked if there were any vacancies; to which interrogation he answered \u201cNo!\u201d Then I ventured to inquire if many ships were to be put in commission soon. At which question he surveyed me with a look of ineffable contempt; and, pushing us out of his office, locked the door without deigning us another word. We went down stairs, and conferred together on our expectations, when I understood that each of them had been recommended to one or other of the commissioners, and each of them promised the first vacancy that should fall; but that none of them relied solely upon that interest, without a present to the secretary, with whom some of the commissioners went snacks. For which reason, each of them had provided a small purse; and I was asked what I proposed to give. This was a vexatious question to me who (far from being in a capacity to gratify a ravenous secretary) had not wherewithal to purchase a dinner. I therefore answered, I had not yet determined what to give; and sneaked off toward my own lodging, lamenting my fate all the way, and inveighing with much bitterness against the barbarity of my grandfather, and the sordid avarice of my relations, who left me a prey to contempt and indigence.\n\nFull of these disagreeable reflections, I arrived at the house where I lodged, and relieved my landlord from great anxiety on my account; for this honest man believed I had met with some dismal accident, and that he never should see me again. Strap, who had come to visit me in the morning, understanding I had been abroad all night, was almost distracted, and after having obtained leave of his master, had gone in quest of me, though he was even more ignorant of the town than I. Not being willing to inform the landlord of my adventure, I told him I had met an acquaintance at Surgeons\u2019 Hall, with whom I spent the evening and night; but being very much infested with bugs, I had not slept much, and therefore intended to take a little repose; so saying, I went to bed, and desired to be awakened if Strap should happen to come while I should be asleep. I was accordingly roused by my friend himself, who entered my chamber about three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and presented a figure to my eyes that I could scarce believe real. In short, this affectionate shaver, setting out towards Surgeons\u2019 Hall, had inquired for me there to no purpose: from whence he found his way to the Navy Office, where he could hear no tidings of me, because I was unknown to everybody then present; he afterwards went upon \u2019Change, in hopes of seeing me upon the Scotch walk, but without success.\n\nAt last, being almost in despair of finding me, he resolved to ask everybody he met in the street, if perchance anyone could give him information about me! and actually put his resolution in practice, in spite of the scoffs, curses, and reproaches with which he was answered; until a blacksmith\u2019s \u2019prentice seeing him stop a porter with a burden on his back, and hearing his question, for which he received a hearty curse, called to him, and asked if the person he inquired after was not a Scotchman? Strap replied with great eagerness, \u201cYes, and had on a brown coat, with long skirts.\u201d \u201cThe same!\u201d said the blacksmith. \u201cI saw him pass by an hour ago,\u201d \u201cDid you so?\u201d cried Strap, rubbing his hands, \u201cOdd! I am very glad of that\u2014which way went he?\u201d \u201cTowards Tyburn in a cart,\u201d said he, \u201cif you make good speed, you may get thither time enough to see him hanged.\u201d This piece of wit incensed my friend to such a degree, that he called the blacksmith scoundrel, and protested he would fight him for half-a-farthing. \u201cNo, no!\u201d said the other, stripping; \u201cI\u2019ll have none of your money\u2014you Scotchmen seldom carry anything about you; but I\u2019ll fight you for love.\u201d There was a ring immediately formed by the mob: and Strap, finding he could not get off honourably without fighting, at the same time burning with resentment against his adversary, quitted his clothes to the care of the multitude, and the battle began with great violence on the side of Strap, who in a few minutes exhausted his breath and spirits on his patient antagonist, who sustained the assault with great coolness, till finding the barber quite spent, he returned the blows he had lent him, with such interest, that Strap, after having received three falls on the hard stones, gave out, and allowed the blacksmith to be the better man.\n\nThe victory being thus decided, it was proposed to adjourn to a cellar hard by, and drink friends. But when my friend began to gather up his clothes, he perceived that some honest person or other had made free with his shirt, neckcloth, hat, and wig, which were carried off; and probably his coat and waistcoat would have met with the same fate, had they been worth stealing. It was in vain for him to make a noise, which only yielded mirth to the spectators; he was fain to get off in this manner, which he accomplished with much difficulty and appeared before me all besmeared with blood and dirt. Notwithstanding this misfortune, such was his transport at finding me safe and sound, that he had almost stifled and stunk me to death with his embraces. After he had cleaned himself, and put on one of my shirts, and a woollen nightcap, I recounted to him the particulars of my night\u2019s campaign, which filled him with admiration, and made him repeat with great energy an observation which was often in his mouth, namely, \u2018that surely London is the devil\u2019s drawing-room.\u2019 As neither of us had dined, he desired me to get up, and the milkwoman coming round at that instant, he went downstairs, and brought up a quart, with a penny loaf, on which we made a comfortable meal. He then shared his money with me, which amounted to eighteen-pence, and left me with an intention to borrow an old wig and hat of his friend the schoolmaster.\n\nHe was no sooner gone, than I began to consider my situation with great uneasiness, and revolved all the schemes my imagination could suggest, in order to choose and pursue some one that would procure me bread; for it is impossible to express the pangs I felt, when I reflected on the miserable dependence in which I lived at the expense of a poor barber\u2019s boy. My pride took the alarm, and having no hopes of succeeding at the Navy Office, I came to a resolution of enlisting in the foot-guards next day, be the event what it would. This extravagant design, by flattering my disposition, gave great satisfaction; and I was charging the enemy at the head of my own regiment, when Strap\u2019s return interrupted my reverie. The schoolmaster had made him a present of the tie-wig which he wore, when I was introduced to him, together with an old hat, whose brims would have overshadowed a Colossus. Though Strap had ventured to wear them in the dusk, he did not choose to entertain the mob by day; therefore went to work immediately, and reduced them both to a moderate size. While he was employed in this office, he addressed me thus: \u201cTo be sure, Mr. Random, you are born a gentleman, and have a great deal of learning\u2014and, indeed, look like a gentleman; for, as to person, you may hold up your head with the best of them. On the other hand, I am a poor but honest cobbler\u2019s son: my mother was as industrious a woman as ever broke bread, till such time as she took to drinking, which you very well know; but everybody has failings\u2014Humanum est errare. Now myself, I am a poor journeyman barber, tolerably well made and understand some Latin, and have a smattering of Greek; but what of that? Perhaps I might also say, that I know a little of the world; but that is to no purpose,\u2014though you be gentle, and I simple, it does not follow, but that I who am simple may do a good office to you who are gentle. Now this is the case: my kinsman, the schoolmaster\u2014perhaps you did not know how nearly he is related to me\u2014I\u2019ll satisfy you in that presently; his mother and my grandmother\u2019s sister\u2019s nephew\u2014no, that\u2019s not it!\u2014my grandfather\u2019s brother\u2019s daughter\u2014rabbit it! I have forgot the degree. But this I know, he and I are cousins seven times removed.\u201d My impatience to know the good office he had done me, got the better of my temper, and I interrupted him at this place with the exclamation, \u201cIf the schoolmaster or you can be of any advantage to me, why don\u2019t you tell me without all this preamble?\u201d When I pronounced these words with some vehemence, Strap looked at me for same time with a grave countenance, and then went on: \u201cI\u2019m very sorry to see such an alteration in your temper of late; you were always fiery, but now you are grown as crabbed as old Periwinkle the drunken tinker, on whom you and I (God forgive us!) played so many unlucky tricks while we were at school\u2014but I will no longer detain you in suspense, because (doubtless) nothing is more uneasy than doubt\u2014Dubio procul dubio nil dubius. My friend or relation, or which you will, or both, the schoolmaster, being informed of the regard I have for you; for you may be sure I did not fail to let him know of your good qualities\u2014by the bye, he has undertaken to teach you the pronunciation of the English tongue, without which, he says, you will be unfit for business in this country\u2014I say my relation has spoke in your behalf to a French apothecary who wants a journeyman; and on his recommendation you may have fifteen pounds a year, bed and board, whenever you please.\u201d I was too much interested in this piece of news to entertain it with indifference; but, jumping up, insisted on Strap\u2019s immediately accompanying me to the house of his friend, that I might not lose this opportunity through the least delay or neglect on my part.\n\nWe were informed, that the schoolmaster was in company at a publichouse in the neighbourhood, whither we repaired, and found him drinking with the very individual apothecary in question. When he was called to the door at our desire, and observed my impatience, he broke out into his usual term of admiration. \u201cOh! I suppose, when you heard of this offer, you did not take leisure enough to come downstairs, but leaped out of the window: did you overturn no porter nor oyster-woman in your way? It was a mercy of God you did not knock your brains out against some post in your career. Oh, my conscience! I believe, had I been in the inmost recesses of my habitation\u2014the very penetralia\u2014your eagerness would have surmounted bolts, bars, decency, and everything. The den of Cacus, or sanctum sanctorum, could not have hid me from you. But come along the gentleman of whom I spoke is in the house; I will present you to him forthwith.\u201d When I entered the room, I perceived four or five people smoking, one of whom the schoolmaster accosted thus: \u201cMr. Lavement, here\u2019s the young man of whom I spoke to you.\u201d The apothecary, who was a little old withered man, with a forehead about an inch high, a nose turned up at the end, large cheek-bones that helped to form a pit for his little gray eyes, a great bag of loose skin hanging down on each side in wrinkles, like the alforjos of a baboon, and a mouth so much accustomed to that contraction which produces grinning, that he could not pronounce a syllable without discovering the remains of his teeth, which consisted of four yellow fangs, not improperly, by anatomists, called canine. This person, I say, after having eyed me some time, said, \u201cOho, \u2019tis ver well, Monsieur Concordance; young man, you are ver welcome, take one coup of bierre\u2014and come to mine house to-morrow morning; Monsieur Concordance vil show you de way.\u201d Upon this I made my bow, and as I went out of the room could hear him say, \u201cMa foi! c\u2019est un beau gar\xe7on; c\u2019est un gaillard.\u201d\n\nAs I had by my own application, while I served Crab, acquired the French tongue well enough to read authors written in that language and understand anything that occurred in conversation, I determined to pretend ignorance to my new master, that he and his family, whom I supposed to be of the same country, not being on the reserve before me, I might possibly discover something in discourse, which would either yield me amusement or advantage. Next morning Mr. Concordance carried me to the apothecary\u2019s house, where the bargain was made, and orders given to provide an apartment for me immediately. But before I entered upon business the schoolmaster recommended me to his tailor, who gave me credit for a suit of clothes, to be paid out of the first moiety of my wages, and they were begun upon that very day; he afterwards accommodated me with a new hat on the same term: so that in a few days I hoped to make a very fashionable appearance. In the meantime, Strap conveyed my baggage to the place allotted for me, which was a back room up two pair of stairs, furnished with a pallet for me to lie upon, a chair without a back, a bottle by way of candlestick, and a triangular piece of glass instead of a mirror; the rest of its ornaments having been lately removed to one of the garrets, for the convenience of the servant of an Irish captain, who lodged in the first floor.\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nThe character of Mr. Lavement, his wife and daughter\u2014some anecdotes of the family\u2014the mother and daughter rivals\u2014I am guilty of a mistake that gives me present satisfaction, but is attended with troublesome consequences\n\nNext day, while I was at work in the shop, a bouncing damsel well dressed came on pretence of finding a vial for some use or other; and taking an opportunity, when she thought I did not mind her, of observing me narrowly, went away with a silent look of disdain. I easily guessed her sentiments, and my pride took the resolution of entertaining the same indifference and neglect towards her. At dinner the maids, with whom I dined in the kitchen, gave me to understand that this was my master\u2019s only daughter, who would have a very handsome fortune, on account of which, and her beauty, a great many young gentlemen made their addresses to her\u2014that she had been twice on the brink of marriage, but disappointed by the stinginess of her father, who refused to part with a shilling to promote the match; for which reason the young lady did not behave to her father with all the filial veneration that might be expected. In particular she harboured the most perfect hatred for his countrymen; in which disposition she resembled her mother, who was an English-woman; and, by the hints they dropped, I learned the gray mare was the better horse\u2014that she was a matron of a high spirit, which was often manifested at the expense of her dependents; that she loved diversions, and looked upon miss as her rival in all parties\u2014which was indeed the true cause of her disappointments; for had the mother been hearty in her interest, the father would not have ventured to refuse her demands. Over and above this intelligence, I, of myself, soon made more discoveries. Mr. Lavement\u2019s significant grins at his wife, while she looked another way, convinced me that he was not at all content with his lot; and his behaviour in presence of the captain made me believe his chief torment was jealousy. As for my own part, I was considered in no other light than that of a menial servant, and had been already six days in the house without being honoured with one word from either mother or daughter; the latter (as I understood from the maids) having at table one day expressed some surprise that her papa should entertain such an awkward mean-looking journeyman. I was nettled at this piece of information, and next Sunday (it being my turn to take my diversion) dressed myself in my new clothes to the greatest advantage, and, vanity apart, made no contemptible figure.\n\nAfter having spent most part of the day in company with Strap and some of his acquaintance, I came home in the afternoon, and was let in by miss, who not knowing me, dropped a low curtsey as I advanced, which I returned with a profound bow, and shut the door. By the time I had turned about, she had perceived her mistake, and changed colour, but did not withdraw. The passage being narrow, I could not get away without jolting her; so I was forced to remain where I was with my eyes fixed to the ground, and my face glowing with blushes. At length, her vanity coming to her assistance, she went away tittering, and I could hear her pronounce the word \u2018creature!\u2019 From this day forward, she came into the shop fifty times, every day upon various pretences, and put in practice so many ridiculous airs, that I could easily perceive her opinion of me was changed, and that she did not think me altogether an unworthy conquest. But my heart was so steeled against her charms by pride and resentment, which were two chief ingredients in my disposition, that I remained insensible to all her arts; and notwithstanding some advances she made, could not be prevailed upon to yield her the least attention. This neglect soon banished all the favourable impressions she felt for me, and the rage of a slighted woman took place in her heart; this she manifested not only in all the suggestions her malice could invent to my prejudice with her father, but also in procuring for me such servile employments as she hoped would sufficiently humble my spirit. One day in particular, she ordered me to brush my master\u2019s coat; but I refusing, a smart dialogue ensued, which ended in her bursting into tears of rage; when her mother interposing, and examining into the merits of the cause, determined it in my favour: and this good office I owed not to any esteem or consideration she had for me, but solely to the desire of mortifying her daughter, who on this occasion observed, that let people be never so much in the right, there were some folks who would never do them justice, but, to be sure, they had their reasons for it, which some people were ignorant of, although they despised their little arts. This insinuation of some people and some folks put me upon observing the behaviour of my mistress more narrowly for the future: and it was not long before I had reason to believe that she looked upon her daughter as a rival in the affections of Captain O\u2019Donnell, who lodged in the house.\n\nIn the meantime, my industry and knowledge gained me the goodwill of my master, who would often say in French, \u201cMardy! c\u2019est un bon gar\xe7on.\u201d He had a great deal of business; but he was mostly employed among his fellow refugees, his profits were small. However, his expense for medicines was not great; for he was the most expert man at a succedaneum of any apothecary in London, so that I have been sometimes amazed to see him, without the least hesitation, make up a physician\u2019s prescription, though he had not in his shop one medicine mentioned in it. Oyster-shells he could convert into crab\u2019s eyes; common oil into oil of sweet almonds; syrup of sugar into balsamic syrup; Thames water into aqua cinnamoni; and a hundred more costly preparations were produced in an instant, from the cheapest and coarsest drugs of the materia medica: and when any common thing was ordered for a patient, he always took care to disguise it in colour or taste, or both, in such a manner that it could not possibly be known; for which purpose cochineal and oil of cloves were of great service. Mr. Lavement had attempted more than once to introduce a vegetable diet into his family, by launching out into the praise of roots and greens, and decrying the use of flesh, both as a physician and philosopher; but all his rhetoric could not make one proselyte to his opinion, and even the wife of his bosom declared against the proposal.\n\nOne afternoon, when her husband was abroad, and his daughter gone to visit, this lady ordered me to call a hackney-coach, in which she and the captain drove towards Covent Garden. Miss came home in the evening, and, supping at her usual hour, went to bed. About eleven o\u2019clock my master entered, and asked if his wife was gone to sleep: upon which I told him, my mistress went out in the afternoon, and was not yet returned. This was like a clap of thunder to the poor apothecary, who starting back, cried, \u201cMort de ma vie! vat you tell a me? My vife not at home!\u201d At that instant a patient\u2019s servant arrived with a prescription for a draught, which my master taking, went into the shop to make it up with his own hand. While he rubbed the ingredients in a glass mortar, he inquired of me, whether or no his wife went out alone; and no sooner heard that she was in company with the captain, than with one blow he split the mortar into a thousand pieces, and grinning like the head of a bass viol, exclaimed, \u201cAh, traitresse!\u201d It would have been impossible for me to have preserved my gravity a minute longer, when I was happily relieved by a rap at the door, which I opened, and perceived my mistress coming out of the coach. She flounced immediately into the shop, and addressed her husband thus: \u201cI suppose you thought I was lost, my dear. Captain O\u2019Donnell has been so good as to treat me with a play.\u201d The reply, it may be supposed, was anything but courteous but the captain, who had been all the time at the door discharging the coach, entered, and Mr. Lavement, changing his tone, saluted him with all the usual politesse of a Frenchman.\n\nShortly after this event, by the knowledge which I acquired of the family secrets, my life became much more agreeable; and as I every day improved in my knowledge of the town I shook off my awkward air by degrees, and acquired the character of a polite journeyman apothecary.\nCHAPTER XX\n\nI am assaulted and dangerously wounded\u2014suspect O\u2019Donnell, and am confirmed in my opinion\u2014concert a scheme of revenge, and put it into execution\u2014O\u2019Donnell robs his own servant and disappears\u2014make my addresses to a lady, and am miraculously delivered from her snare\n\nOne night, at about twelve o\u2019clock, as I returned from visiting a patient at Chelsea, I received a blow on my head from an unseen hand, that stretched me senseless on the ground; and was left for dead with three stabs of a sword in my body. The groans I uttered when I recovered the use of my reason alarmed the people of a solitary alehouse that stood near the spot where I lay: and they were humane enough to take me in, and send for a surgeon, who dressed my wounds, and assured me they were not mortal. One of them penetrated through the skin and muscles of one side of my belly in such a manner, that doubtless the assassin imagined he had run me through the entrails. The second slanted along one of my ribs; and the last, which was intended for the finishing stroke, having been directed to my heart, the sword snapped upon my breast-bone, and the point remained sticking in the skin. When I reflected upon this event, I could not persuade myself that I had been assaulted by a common footpad, because it is not usual for such people to murder though they rob, especially when they meet with no resistance; and I found my money, and everything else about me but my carcase, safe. I concluded, therefore, that I must either have been mistaken for another, or obliged to the private resentment of some secret enemy for what had happened; and as I could remember nobody who had the least cause of complaint against me, except Captain O\u2019Donnell and my master\u2019s daughter, my suspicion settled upon them, though I took care to conceal it, that I might the sooner arrive at confirmation.\n\nWith this view, I went home in the chair about ten o\u2019clock in the morning; and as the chairman supported me into the house, met the captain in the passage, who no sooner saw me than he started back and gave evident signs of guilty confusion, which he would have accounted for from surprise occasioned by the seeing me in such a condition. My master having heard my story, condoled me with a good deal of sympathy, and when he understood my wounds were not dangerous, ordered me to be carried upstairs to bed; though not without some opposition from his wife, who was of opinion that it would be better for me to go to an hospital, where I should be more carefully attended. My meditation was employed in concerting with myself some method of revenge against Squire O\u2019Donnell and his inamorata, whom I looked upon as the author of my misfortune; when miss, who was not at home at my arrival, entered my chamber, and saying she was sorry for the accident that had befallen me, asked if I suspected anybody to be the assassin; upon which I fixed my eyes steadfastly upon her and answered, \u201cYes.\u201d She discovered no symptom of confusion, but replied hastily, \u201cIf that be the case, why don\u2019t you take out a warrant, to have him apprehended? It will cost but a trifle\u2014if you have no money, I\u2019ll lend you.\u201d This frankness not only cured me of my suspicion with respect to her, but even staggered my belief with regard to the captain, of whose guilt I resolved to have further proof before I should enterprise anything in the way of revenge. I thanked her kindly for her generous offer, which, however, I had no occasion to accept, being determined to do nothing rashly: for though I could plainly perceive the person who attacked me to be a soldier, whose face I thought was familiar to me, I could not swear with a safe conscience to any particular man; and, granting I could, my prosecution of him would not much avail.\n\nThis uncertainty I pretended, lest the captain, hearing from her that I knew the person who wounded me, might think proper to withdraw before I could be in a condition to requite him. In two days I was up and able to do a little business, so that Mr. Lavement made shift to carry on his practice without hiring another journeyman in my room.\n\nThe first thing I attempted towards a certain discovery of my secret enemy, was to get into O\u2019Donnell\u2019s apartment, while he was abroad in an undress, and examine his sword, the point of which being broken off, I applied the fragment that was found sticking in my body, and found it answered the fractured part exactly. There was no room left for doubt; and all that remained was to fix upon a scheme of revenge, which almost solely engrossed my thoughts during the space of eight nights and days. Sometimes I was tempted to fall upon him in the same manner as he had practised upon me, and kill him outright. But this assault my honour opposed as a piece of barbarous cowardice, in which he was not to be imitated. At other times I entertained thoughts of demanding satisfaction in an honourable way; but was diverted from this undertaking by considering the uncertainty of the event, and the nature of the injury he had done me, which did not entitle him to such easy terms. At last I determined to pursue a middle course, and actually put my design in execution after this manner. Having secured the assistance of Strap and two of his acquaintance whom he could depend upon, we provided ourselves with disguises, and I caused the following letter to be delivered to him by one of our associates in livery, one Sunday evening:\u2014\n\n\u201cSir\u2014If I may be allowed to judge from appearance, it will not be disagreeable for you to hear that my husband is gone to Bagshot to visit a patient, and will not return till to-morrow night; so that, if you have anything to propose to me (as your behaviour on many occasions has seemed to insinuate), you will do well to embrace the present opportunity of seeing,\n\nYours, etc.\u201d\n\nThis letter was signed with the name of an apothecary\u2019s wife who lived in Chelsea, of whom I had heard O\u2019Donnell was an admirer. Everything succeeded to our wish. The hero hastened towards the place of appointment, and was encountered by us in the very place where he had assaulted me. We rushed upon him all at once, secured his sword, stripped off his clothes even to the skin, which was scourged with nettles till he was blistered from head to foot, notwithstanding all the eloquence of his tears and supplications. When I was satisfied with the stripes I had bestowed, we carried off his clothes, which we hid in a hedge near the place, and left him stark naked to find his way home in the best manner he could, while I took care to be there before him. I afterwards understood that, in his way to the lodgings of a friend, who lived in the skirts of the town, he was picked up by the watch, who carried him to the round-house, from whence he sent for clothes to his lodgings, and next morning arrived at the door in a chair, wrapt up in a blanket he had borrowed; for his body was so sore and swelled, that he could not bear to be confined in his wearing apparel. He was treated with the utmost tenderness by my mistress and her daughter, who vied with each other in their care and attendance of him; but Lavement himself could not forbear expressing his joy, by several malicious grins, while he ordered me to prepare an unguent for his sores. As to myself, nobody can doubt my gratification, when I had every day an opportunity of seeing my revenge protracted on the body of my adversary, by the ulcers of which I had been the cause; and, indeed, I not only enjoyed the satisfaction of having flea\u2019d him alive, but another also which I had not foreseen. The story of his being attacked and stripped in such a place having been inserted in the news, gave information to those who found his clothes next day, whither to bring them; and accordingly he retrieved everything he had lost except a few letters, among which was that which I had writ to him in the name of the apothecary\u2019s wife. This, and the others, which were all on the subject of love (for this Hibernian hero was one of those people who are called fortune-hunters), fell into the hands of a certain female author, famous for the scandal she has published; who, after having embellished them with some ornaments of her own invention, gave them to the to town in print. I was very much shocked on reflection, that I might possibly be the occasion of a whole family\u2019s unhappiness on account of the letter I had written; but was eased of that apprehension, when I understood that the Chelsea apothecary had commenced a lawsuit against the printer for defamation, and looked upon the whole as a piece of forgery committed by the author, who had disappeared. But whatever might be his opinion of the matter, our two ladies seemed to entertain a different idea of it: for as soon as the pamphlet appeared, I could perceive their care of their patient considerably diminish, till at last it ended in a total neglect. It was impossible for him to be ignorant of this change, any more than of the occasion of it; but as he was conscious to himself of having deserved worse than contempt at their hands, he was glad to come off so cheaply, and contented himself with muttering curses and threats against the apothecary, who, as he imagined, having got an inkling of the appointment with his wife, had taken revenge of him in the manner described. By the time he had got a new scarf skin his character was become so notorious, that he thought it high time for him to decamp; and his retreat he performed in one night, without beat of drum, after having robbed his own servant of everything that belonged to him except the clothes he had on his back.\n\nA few days after he disappeared, Mr. Lavement, for his own security, took into his custody a large old trunk which he had left; and as it was very heavy, made no question that the contents were sufficient to indemnify him for what O\u2019Donnell owed in lodging. But a month being elapsed without hearing any tidings of this adventurer, and my master being impatient to know what the trunk contained, he ordered me to break it open in his presence, which task I performed with the pestle of our great mortar, and discovered, to his inexpressible astonishment and mortification, a heap of stones.\n\nAbout this time, my friend Strap informed me of an offer he had to go abroad with a gentleman in quality of valet de chambre and at the same time assured me that, whatever advantage he might propose to himself from this prospect, he could not bear the thoughts of parting from me, so much was he attached to my fortune. In spite of all the obligations I owed to this poor, honest fellow, ingratitude is so natural to the heart of man, that I began to be tired of his acquaintance: and now that I had contracted other friendships which appeared more creditable, was even ashamed to see a journeyman barber inquiring after me with the familiarity of a companion. I therefore, on pretence of consulting his welfare, insisted upon his accepting the proposal, which he at last determined to embrace, with great reluctance, and in a few days, took his leave of me, shedding a flood of tears, which I could not behold without emotion. I now began to look upon me as of a gentleman in reality; learned to dance, frequented plays during the holidays; became the oracle of an ale-house, where every dispute was referred to my decision; and at length contracted an acquaintance with a young lady, who found means to make a conquest of my heart, and upon whom I prevailed, after much attendance and solicitation, to give me a promise of marriage. As this beautiful creature passed for a rich heiress, I blessed my good fortune, and was actually on the point of crowning all my wishes by matrimony, when I made such a discovery as effectually turned me from my design, and I abandoned all thoughts of marriage for the future.\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nSquire Gawky comes to lodge with my master\u2014is involved in a troublesome affair, out of which he is extricated by me\u2014he marries my master\u2019s daughter\u2014they conspire against me\u2014I am found guilty of theft, discharged\u2014deserted by my friends, I hire a room in St. Gile\u2019s\u2014where, by accident, I find the lady to whom I paid my addresses in a miserable condition\u2014I relieve her\n\nWhen I enjoyed myself at large in this temper of mind, Lavement let his first floor to my countryman and acquaintance, Squire Gawky, who by this time had got a lieutenancy in the army, and such a martial ferocity in his appearance that I was afraid he would remember what happened between us in Scotland, and atone for his breach of appointment then by his punctuality now; but whether he had actually forgot me, or was willing to make me believe so, he betrayed not the least symptom of recognition at sight of me, and I remained quite cured of my apprehension; though I had occasion not long after to be convinced, that howsoever his externals might be altered, he was at bottom the same individual Gawky, whom I have already described. For coming home late one night from the house of a patient, I heard a noise in the street, and as I approached, perceived two gentlemen in custody, of three watchmen. The prisoners, who were miserable, disfigured with dirt, complained bitterly of the loss of their hats and wigs; and one of them, whom by his tongue I know to be a Scotchman, lamented most piteously, offering a guinea for his liberty, which the watchman refused, alleging that one of his companions was wounded grievously, and that he must stand to the consequence. My prejudice in favour of my native country was so strong, that I could not bear to see anybody belonging to it in distress, and therefore, with one blow of my faithful cudgel, knocked down the watchman who had hold of the person for whom I was chiefly concerned. He was no sooner disengaged, than he betook himself to his heels, and left me to maintain the dispute as I should think proper; and, indeed, I came off but scurvily, for, before I could avail myself of my speed, I received a blow on the eye, from one of the other two, that had well nigh deprived me of the use of that organ. However, I made shift to get home, where I was informed of Captain Gawky\u2019s being robbed and abused by a company of footpads, and was ordered by my master to prepare an emollient glyster and paregoric draught, in order to allay and compose the ferment of his spirits, occasioned by the barbarous treatment he had undergone, while he took twelve ounces of blood from him immediately.\n\nWhen I inquired into the particulars of this adventure, and understood by the servant that he came in just before me, without hat and wig, I made no scruple of believing him to be the person I had released, and was confirmed in my belief upon hearing his voice, to which (before that event) I had long been a stranger.\n\nMy eye being considerably swelled and inflamed, I could not reflect upon my enterprise without cursing my own folly, and even resolving to declare the truth of the whole story in order to be revenged on the cowardly wretch for whom I had suffered: accordingly, next day after he had told, in presence of my master, his wife and daughter, who came to him, a thousand lies concerning the prowess he had shown in making his escape, I ventured to explain the mystery, and, calling in the evidence of my contused eye, upbraided him with cowardice and ingratitude. Gawky was so astonished at this that he could not answer one word, and the rest of the company stared at one another; till at length my mistress reprimanded me for my insolent behaviour, and threatened to turn me away for my presumption. Upon which, Gawky (having recollected himself) observed, as the young man might have mistaken another person for him, he could forgive his insinuations, more especially as he seemed to have suffered for his incivility; but advised me to be more certain in my conjectures for the future, before I ventured to publish them to the prejudice of any man. Miss applauded the Captain\u2019s generosity in pardoning one who had so villainously aspersed him, and I began to imagine her praise was not at all disinterested. But the apothecary, who perhaps had more penetration or less partiality than his wife and daughter, differed from them in their sentiments of the matter, and expressed himself to me in the shop in this manner: \u201cAh mon pauvre Roderique! you have more of de veracite dan of de prudence\u2014bot mine vife and dater be diablement sage, and Monsieur le Capitaine un fanfaron, pardieu!\u201d\n\nThis eulogium on his wife and daughter, though spoken ironically by him, was nevertheless literally just; by espousing the cause of Gawky, the one obliged a valuable lodger, and the other acquired a husband at a juncture when one was absolutely necessary. The young lady insinuated herself so artfully into the affection of this new lodger, that in less than a fortnight, on pretence of going to the play, they drove away together to the Fleet, where they were married; and in the morning came home, where they asked her father\u2019s and mother\u2019s blessing. The prudent parents, notwithstanding the precipitation with which the match was carried on, did not think fit to refuse their approbation; for the apothecary was not ill pleased to find his daughter married to a young man of a good prospect, who had not mentioned one syllable on the article of her dowry; and his wife was rejoiced at being rid of a rival and a spy upon her. Whatever face Gawky put on the matter, my discovery of the adventure before related, and the reproaches I vented against him, had stung him to the soul, and cherished the seeds of enmity so strongly in his breast, that he imparted his indignation to his wife, who being as desirous as himself to accomplish the ruin of one that not only slighted her caresses, but was able on any occasion to discover particulars not at all advantageous to her character, readily joined in a conspiracy against me, which (had it taken effect as they expected) would infallibly have brought me to an ignominious death.\n\nMy master having several times missed large quantities of medicines, of which I could give no account, at last lost all patience, and in plain terms taxed me with having embezzled them for my own use. As I could only oppose my single asseveration to his suspicion, he told me one day, \u201cYour vord not be give me de satisfaction\u2014me find necessaire to chercher for my medicine; pardonnez moi\u2014il faut chercher\u2014me demand le clef of your coffre a cette heure.\u201d Then raising his voice to conceal the fright he was in lest I should make any opposition, he went on, \u201cOui! I charge you rendez le clef of your coffre\u2014moi\u2014si, moi qui vous parle.\u201d I was fired with so much resentment and disdain at this accusation, that I burst into tears, which he took for a sign of guilt; and pulling out my key, told him he might satisfy himself immediately, though he would not find it so easy to satisfy me for the injury my reputation had suffered from his unjust suspicion. He took the key and mounted up to my chamber, attended by the whole family, saying, \u201cEh bien, nous verrons\u2014nous verrons.\u201d But what was my horror and amazement, when, opening my chest, he pulled out a handful of the very things that were missing, and pronounced, \u201cAh, ha, vous etes bienvenu\u2014mardy, Mons. Roderique, you be fort innocent!\u201d I had not power to utter one word in my own vindication, but stood motionless and silent, while everybody present made their respective remarks on what appeared against me. The servants said they were sorry for my misfortune, and went away repeating, \u201cWho would have thought it?\u201d My mistress took occasion from this detection to rail against the practice of employing strangers in general; and Mrs. Gawky, after having observed that she never had a good opinion of my fidelity, proposed to have me carried before the justice and committed to Newgate immediately. Her husband was actually upon the stairs in his way for a constable, when Mr. Lavement knowing the cost and trouble of a prosecution to which he must bind himself, and at the same time dreading lest some particulars of my confession might affect his practice, called out. \u201cRestez, mon fils! restez, it be veritablement one grand crime which dis pauvre diable have committed\u2014bot peut-etre de good God give him de penitence, and me vill not have upon mine head de blood of one sinner.\u201d The captain and his lady used all the Christian arguments their zeal could suggest to prevail upon the apothecary to pursue me to destruction, and represented the injustice he did to the community of which he was a member, in letting a villain escape, who would not fail of doing more mischief in the world when he should reflect on his coming off so easily now; but their eloquence made no impression on my master, who turning to me said, \u201cGo, miserable, go from mine house quick, quick!\u2014and make reparation for your mauvaise actions.\u201d By this time my indignation had roused me from the stupefaction in which I had hitherto remained and I began in this manner:\u2014\u201cSir, appearances I own condemn me; but you are imposed upon as much as I am abused: I have fallen a sacrifice to the rancour of that scoundrel\u201d (pointing to Gawky) \u201cwho has found means to convey your goods hither, that the detection of them might blast my reputation, and accomplish my destruction. His hatred to me is owing to a consciousness of his having wronged me in my own country\u2014for which injury he in a cowardly manner, refused me the satisfaction of a gentleman; he knows, moreover, that I am no stranger to his dastardly behaviour in this town, which I have recounted before, and he is unwilling that such a testimony of his ingratitude and pusillanimity should live upon the earth; for this reason he is guilty of the most infernal malice to bring about my ruin. And I am afraid, madam (turning to Mrs. Gawky) you have too easily entered into the sentiments of your husband. I have often found you my enemy, and am well acquainted with the occasion of your being so, which I don\u2019t at present think proper to declare; but I would advise you, for your own sake, not to drive me to extremity.\u201d This address enraged her so much that with a face as red us scarlet and the eyes of a fury, she strutted up to me and putting her hands in her side, spat in my face, saying, I was a scandalous villain, but she defied my malice; and that unless her papa would not prosecute me like a thief as I was, she would not stay another night under his roof. At the same time, Gawky assuming a big look, told me, he scorned what lies I could invent against him; but that, if I pretended to asperse his wife, he would put me to death. To this threat I answered, \u201cI wish I could meet with thee in a desert, that I might have an opportunity of punishing thee for thy perfidy towards me, and rid the world of such a rascal. What hinders me this moment,\u201d said I, seizing an old bottle that stood by, \u201cfrom doing myself that justice?\u201d I had no sooner armed myself in this manner, than Gawky and his father-in-law retired in such a hurry, that the one overturned the other, and they rolled together down stairs, while my mistress swooned away with fear, and her daughter asked if I intended to murder her. I gave her to understand, that nothing was farther from my intention, that I would leave her to the stings of her own conscience; but was firmly resolved to slit her husband\u2019s nose, whenever fortune should offer a convenient opportunity. Then going down stairs, I met Lavement coming up trembling with the pestle in his hand, and Gawky behind armed with his sword, pushing him forward. I demanded a parley: and having assured him of my pacific disposition, Gawky exclaimed, \u201cAh, villain! you have killed my dear wife.\u201d And the apothecary cried, \u201cAh, coquin! vere is my shild?\u201d \u201cThe lady,\u201d said I, \u201cis above stairs, unhurt by me, and will, a few months hence, I believe reward your concern.\u201d Here she called to them, and desired they would let the wretch go, and trouble themselves no further about him. To which request her father consented, observing, nevertheless, that my conversation was \u2018very mysterious.\u2019\n\nFinding it impossible to vindicate my innocence, I left the house immediately, and went to the schoolmaster, with an intention of clearing myself to him, and asking his advice with regard to my future conduct; but, to my inexpressible vexation, he was gone to the country, where he would stay two or three days. I returned with a design of consulting some acquaintance I had acquired in the neighbourhood; but my story had taken air through the officiousness of the servants, and not one of my friends would vouchsafe me a hearing. Thus I found myself, by the iniquity of mankind, in a much more deplorable condition than ever: for though I had been formerly as poor, my reputation was without blemish, and my health unimpaired till now; but at present my good name was lost, my money gone, my friends were alienated, my body was infected by an odious distemper; and my faithful Strap, who alone could yield me pity and assistance, absent I knew not where.\n\nThe first resolution I could take in this melancholy conjuncture, was to remove my clothes to the house of the person with whom I had formerly lodged, where I remained two days in hopes of getting another place by the interest of Mr. Concordance, to whom I made no doubt of being able to vindicate my character; but in this supposition I reckoned without my best, for Lavement took care to be beforehand with me; and when I attempted to explain the whole affair to the schoolmaster, I found him so prepossessed against me, that he would scarce hear me to an end; but when I had finished my justification, shook his head, and beginning with his usual exclamation said, \u201cThat won\u2019t go down with me. I am very sorry I should have the misfortune of being concerned in the affair, but, however, shall be more cautious for the future. I will trust no man from henceforward\u2014no, not my father who begat me, nor the brother who lay with me in my mother\u2019s womb: should Daniel rise from the dead, I would think him an impostor; and were the genius of truth to appear, would question its veracity!\u201d I told him, that one day it was possible he might be convinced of the injury I had suffered, and repent of his premature determination. To which remark he answered, the proof of my innocence would make his bowels vibrate with joy; \u201cbut till that shall happen,\u201d continued he, \u201cI must beg to have no manner of connection with you\u2014my reputation is at stake. I shall be looked upon as your accomplice and abettor\u2014people will say Jonathan Wild was but a type of me\u2014boys will hoot at me as I pass along; and the cinder-wenches belch forth reproaches wafted in a gale impregnated with gin: I shall be notorious\u2014the very butt of slander, and sink of infamy!\u201d I was not in a humour to relish the climax of expressions upon which this gentleman valued himself in all his discourses; but, without any ceremony, took my leave, cursed with every sentiment of horror which my situation could suggest. I considered, however, in the intervals of my despondence, that I must, in some shape suit my expense to my calamitous circumstances, and with that view hired an apartment in a garret near St. Giles\u2019s, at the rate of nine-pence per week.\n\nI one day, when I sat in this solitary retreat musing upon the unhappiness of my fate, was alarmed by a groan that issued from a chamber contiguous to mine, into which I immediately ran, and found a woman stretched on a miserable truckle bed, without any visible signs of life. Having applied a smelling bottle to her nose, the blood began to revisit her cheeks, and she opened her eyes; but, good heaven! what were the emotions of my soul, when I discovered her to be the same individual lady who had triumphed over my heart, and to whose fate I had almost been inseparably joined! Her deplorable situation filled my breast with compassion. She knew me immediately; and, straining me gently in her arms, shed a torrent of tears, which I could not help increasing. At length, casting a languishing look at me, she pronounced with a feeble voice, \u201cDear Mr. Random, I do not deserve this concern at your hands: I am a vile creature, who had a base design upon your person\u2014suffer me, to expiate that, and all my other crimes, by a miserable death, which will not fail to overtake me in a few hours.\u201d I encouraged her as much as I could, told her I forgave all her intentions with regard to me; and that, although my circumstances were extremely low, I would share my last farthing with her. I begged in the meantime to know the immediate cause of that fit from which she had just recovered, and said, I would endeavour by my skill to prevent any more such attacks. She seemed very much affected with this expression, took my hand, and pressed it to her lips, saying, \u201cYou are too generous! I wish I could live to express my gratitude\u2014but alas! I perish for want.\u201d Then shutting her eyes, she relapsed into another swoon. Such extremity of distress must have waked the most obdurate heart to sympathy and compassion; what effect then must it have had on mine, that was naturally prone to every tender passion? I ran downstairs, and sent my landlady to a chemist\u2019s shop for some cinnamon water, while I, returning to this unfortunate creature\u2019s chamber, used all the means in my power to bring her to herself; this aim with much difficulty I accomplished, and made her drink a glass of the cordial to recruit her spirits: then I prepared a little mulled red wine and a toast, which having taken, she found herself thoroughly revived, and informed me, that she had not tasted food for eight and forty hours before. As I was impatient to know the occasion and nature of her calamity, she gave me to understand, that she was a woman of the town by profession; that in the course of her adventures she found herself dangerously infected with a distemper, to which all of her class are particularly subject; that her malady gaining ground every day, she became loathsome to herself and offensive to others: when she resolved to retire to some obscure corner where she might be cured with as little noise and expense as possible; that she had accordingly chosen this place of retreat, and put herself into the hands of an advertising doctor, who having fleeced her of all the money she had, or could procure, left her three days ago in a worse condition than that in which he found her; that except the clothes on her back, she had pawned or sold everything that belonged to her to satisfy that rapacious quack, and quiet the clamour of her landlady, who still persisted in her threats to turn her out into the street. After having moralised upon these particulars, I proposed that she should lodge in the same room with me, an expedient that would save some money: and assured her, I would undertake to cure her as well as my own, during which she should partake of all the conveniences that I could afford to myself. She embraced my offer with unfeigned acknowledgment, and I began to put it in practice immediately. I found her not only an agreeable companion, whose conversation greatly alleviated my chagrin, but also a careful nurse, who served me with the utmost fidelity and affection. One day, while I testified my surprise that a woman of her beauty, good sense, and education (for she had a large portion of each), could be reduced to such an infamous and miserable way of life, she answered with a sigh, \u201cThese very advantages were the cause of my undoing.\u201d This remarkable reply inflamed my curiosity to such a degree, that I begged she would favour me with the particulars of her story, and she complied in these words.\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nThe History of Miss Williams\n\n\u2018My father was an eminent merchant in the city who having, in the course of trade, suffered very considerable losses, retired in his old age with his wife to a small estate in the country, which he had purchased with the remains of his fortune. At that time, I being but eight years of age, was left in town for the convenience of education, boarded with an aunt, who was a rigid presbyterian, and confined me so closely to what she called the duties of religion, that in time I grew weary of her doctrines, and by degrees received an aversion for the good books, she daily recommended to my perusal. As I increased in age, and appeared with a person not disagreeable, I contracted a good deal of acquaintance among my own sex; one of whom, after having lamented the restraint I was under from the narrowness of my aunt\u2019s sentiments, told me I must now throw off the prejudices of opinion imbibed under her influence and example, and learn to think for myself; for which purpose she advised me to read Shaftsbury, Tindal, Hobbes, and all the authors that are remarkable for their deviation from the old way of thinking, and by comparing one with the other, I should soon be able to form a system of my own. I followed her advice; and whether it was owing to my prepossession against what I had formerly read, or the clearness of argument in these my new instructors, I know not; but I studied them with pleasure, and in a short time became a professed freethinker. Proud of my improvement, I argued in all companies, and that with such success, that I soon acquired the reputation of a philosopher, and few people durst undertake me in a dispute. I grew vain upon my good fortune, and at length pretended to make my aunt a proselyte to my opinion; but she no sooner perceived my drift than, taking the alarm, she wrote to my father an account of my heresy, and conjured him, as he tendered the good of my soul, to remove me immediately from the dangerous place where I had contracted such sinful principles. Accordingly, my father ordered me into the country, where I arrived in the fifteenth year of my age, and, by his command gave him a detail of all the articles of my faith, which he did not find so unreasonable as they had been represented. Finding myself suddenly deprived of the company and pleasures of the town, I grew melancholy and it was some time before I could relish my situation. But solitude became every day more and more familiar to me and I consoled myself in my retreat with the enjoyment of a good library, at such times as were not employed in the management of the family (for my mother had been dead three years), in visiting, or some other party of rural diversion. Having more imagination than judgment, I addicted myself too much to poetry and romance; and, in short, was looked upon as a very extraordinary person by everybody in the country where I resided.\n\n\u2018I had one evening strayed, with a book in my hand, into a wood that bordered on the high road, at a little distance from my father\u2019s house, when a certain drunken squire, riding by, perceived me, and crying, \u201cHolloa, there\u2019s a charming creature!\u201d alighted in a moment, caught me in his arms, and treated me so rudely that I shrieked as loud as I could, and in the meantime opposed his violence with all the strength that rage and resentment could inspire. During this struggle, another horseman came up, who, seeing a lady so unworthily used, dismounted, and flew to my assistance. The squire, mad with disappointment, or provoked with the reproaches of the other gentleman, quitted me, and running to his horse, drew a pistol from the saddle, and fired it at my protector, who happily receiving no damage, went up, and, with the butt-end of his whip laid him prostrate on the ground before he could use the other, which his antagonist immediately seized, and, clapping to the squire\u2019s breast, threatened to put him to death for his cowardice and treachery. In this dilemma I interposed and begged his life, which was granted to my request, after he had asked pardon, and swore his intention was only to obtain a kiss. However, my defender thought proper to unload the other pistol, and throw away the flints, before he gave him his liberty. This courteous stranger conducted me home, where my father having learned the signal service he had done me, loaded him with caresses, and insisted on his lodging that night at our house. If the obligation he had conferred upon me justly inspired me with sentiments of gratitude, his appearance and conversation seemed to entitle him to somewhat more. He was about the age of two-and-twenty, among the tallest of the middle size; had chestnut-coloured hair, which he wore tied up in a ribbon; a high polished forehead, a nose inclining to the aquiline, lively blue eyes, red pouting lips, teeth as white as snow, and a certain openness of countenance\u2014but why need I describe any more particulars of his person? I hope you will do me the justice to believe I do not flatter, when I say he was the exact resemblance of you; and if I had not been well acquainted with his family and degree, I should have made no scruple of concluding that you was his brother. He spoke and seemed to have no reserve: for what he said was ingenuous, sensible, and uncommon. \u201cIn short,\u201d said she, bursting into tears, \u201che was formed for the ruin of our sex. His behaviour was modest and respectful, but his looks were so significant, that I could easily observe he secretly blessed the occasion that introduced him to my acquaintance. We learned from his discourse that he was the eldest son of a wealthy gentleman in the neighbourhood, to whose name we were no strangers\u2014that he had been to visit an acquaintance in the country, from whose house he was returning home, when my shrieks brought him to my rescue.\u201d\n\n\u2018All night long my imagination formed a thousand ridiculous expectations: there was so much of knight-errantry in this gentleman\u2019s coming to the relief of a damsel in distress, with whom he immediately became enamoured, that all I had read of love and chivalry recurred to my fancy; and I looked upon myself as a princess in some region of romance, who being delivered from the power of some brutal giant or satyr, by a generous Oroondates, was bound in gratitude, as well as led by inclination, to yield up my affections to him without reserve. In vain did I endeavour to chastise these foolish conceits by reflections more reasonable and severe: the amusing images took full possession of my mind, and my dreams represented my hero sighing at my feet, in the language of a despairing lover. Next morning after breakfast he took his leave, when my father begged the favour of further acquaintance with him; to which request he replied by a compliment to him, and a look to me so full of eloquence and tenderness, that my whole soul received the soft impression. In a short time he repeated his visit; and as a recital of the particular steps he pursued to ruin me would be tedious and impertinent, let it suffice to say, he made it his business to insinuate himself into my esteem, by convincing me of his own good sense, and at the same time flattering my understanding. This task he performed in the most artful manner, by seeming to contradict me often through misapprehension, that I might have an opportunity of clearing myself the more to my own honour. Having thus secured my good opinion, he began to give me some tokens of a particular passion, founded on a veneration of the qualities of my mind, and, as an accidental ornament, admired the beauties of my person; till at being fully persuaded of his conquest, he chose a proper season for the theme, and disclosed his love in terms so ardent and sincere, that it was impossible for me to disguise the sentiments of my heart, and he received my approbation with the most lively transport. After this mutual declaration, we contrived to meet more frequently in private interviews, where we enjoyed the conversation of one another, in all the elevation of fancy and impatience of hope that reciprocal adoration can inspire. He professed his honourable intentions, of which I made no question; lamented the avaricious disposition of his father, who had destined him for the arms of another, and vowed eternal fidelity with such an appearance of candour and devotion\u2014that I became a dupe to his deceit. Cursed be the day on which I gave away my innocence and peace! Cursed be my beauty that first attracted the attention of the seducer! Cursed be my education, that, by refining my sentiments, made my heart the more susceptible! Cursed be my good sense, that fixed me to one object, and taught me the preference I enjoyed was but my due! Had I been ugly, nobody would have tempted me; had I been ignorant, the charms of my person would not have atoned for the coarseness of my conversation; had I been giddy, my vanity would have divided my inclinations, and my ideas would have been so diffused, that I should never have listened to the enchantments of one alone.\n\n\u2018But to return to my unfortunate story. After some months, the visits of my lover became less frequent, and his behaviour less warm: I perceived his coldness, my heart took the alarm, my tears reproached him, and I insisted upon the performance of his promise to espouse me, that, whatever should happen, my reputation might be safe. He seemed to acquiesce in my proposal, and left me on pretence of finding a proper clergyman to unite us in the bands of wedlock. But alas! the inconstant had no intention to return. I waited a whole week with the utmost impatience; sometimes doubting his honour, at other times inventing excuses for him, and condemning myself for harbouring suspicions of his faith. At length I understood from a gentleman who dined at our house, that this perfidious wretch was on the point of setting out for London with his bride, to buy clothes for their approaching nuptials. This information distracted me! Rage took possession of my soul; I denounced a thousand imprecations, and formed as many schemes of revenge against the traitor who had undone me. Then my resentment would subside to silent sorrow. I recalled the tranquillity I lost, I wept over my infatuation, and sometimes a ray of hope would intervene, and for a moment cheer my drooping heart; I would revolve all the favourable circumstances of his character, repeat the vows he made, ascribe his absence to the vigilance of a suspicious father who compelled him to a match his soul abhorred, and comfort myself with the expectation of seeing him before the thing should be brought to any terms of agreement. But how vain was my imagination! That villain left me without remorse, and in a few days the news of his marriage were spread all over the country. My horror was then inconceivable; and had not the desire of revenge diverted the resolution, I should infallibly have put an end to my miserable life. My father observed the symptoms of my despair: and though I have good reason to believe he guessed the cause, was at a great deal of pains to seem ignorant of my affliction, while he endeavoured with parental fondness to alleviate my distress. I saw his concern, which increased my anguish, and raised my fury against the author of my calamity to an implacable degree.\n\n\u2018Having furnished myself with a little money, I made an elopement from this unhappy parent in the night-time, and about break of day arrived at a small town, from whence a stage coach set out for London, in which I embarked, and next day alighted in town; the spirit of revenge having supported me all the way against every other reflection, My first care was to hire a lodging, in which I kept myself very retired, assumed a feigned name, that my character and situation might be better concealed. It was not long before I found out the house of my lover, whither I immediately repaired in a transport of rage, determined to act some desperate deed for the satisfaction of my despair, though the hurry of my spirits would not permit me to concert or resolve upon a particular plan. When I demanded admission to Lothario (so let me call him), I was desired to send up my name and business; but this I refused, telling the porter I had business for his master\u2019s private ear; upon which I was conducted into a parlour until he should be informed of my request. There I remained about a quarter of an hour, when a servant entered and told me his master was engaged with company, and begged to be excused at that time. My temper could hold out no longer. I pulled out a poniard from my bosom, where I had concealed it, and rushing out flew up stairs like a fury, exclaiming, \u201cWhere\u2019s this perfidious villain? could I plunge this dagger into his false heart, I should then die satisfied!\u201d The noise I made alarmed not only the servants, but the company also, who hearing my threats came forward to the staircase to see was the matter. I was seized, disarmed, and withheld by two footmen; and in this situation felt the most exquisite torture in beholding my undoer approach with his young wife. I could not endure the sight, was deprived of my senses, and fell into a severe fit, during which I know not how I was treated; but when I recovered the use of reflection, found myself on a bed in a paltry apartment, where I was attended by an old woman, who asked a thousand impertinent questions relating to my condition, and informed me that my behaviour had thrown the whole family into confusion; that Lothario affirmed I was mad, and proposed to have me sent to Bedlam; but my lady persuaded herself there was more in my conduct than he cared should be known, and had taken to her bed on bare suspicion, having first ordered that I should be narrowly looked to. I heard all she said without making any other reply than desiring she would do me the favour to call a chair; but this she told me could not be done without her master\u2019s consent, which, however, was easily procured, and I was conveyed to my lodgings in a state of mind that baffles all description. The agitation of my thoughts produced a fever, which brought on a miscarriage; and I believe it is well for my conscience that heaven thus disposed of my burden; for let me own to you with penitence and horror, if I had brought a living child into the world, my frenzy would have prompted me to sacrifice the little innocent to my resentment of the father\u2019s infidelity.\n\n\u2018After this event my rage abated, and my hate became more deliberate and calm: when one day my landlady informed me that there was a gentleman below who desired to see me, he having something of consequence to impart, which he was sure would contribute to my peace of mind. I was exceedingly alarmed at this declaration, which I attempted to interpret a thousand ways; and before I came to any determination he entered my room, with an apology for intruding without my knowledge or consent. I surveyed him some time, and not being able to recollect his face, demanded, with a faltering accent, what his business was with me? Upon which he desired I would give him a particular audience, and he did not doubt of communicating something that would conduce to my satisfaction and repose. As I thought myself sufficiently guarded against any violence, I granted his request, and bade the woman withdraw. The stranger, then advancing, gave me to understand that he was well acquainted with the particulars of my story, having been informed of them from Lothario\u2019s own mouth\u2014that from the time he knew my misfortunes he had entertained a detestation for the author of them, which had of late been increased and inflamed to a desire of revenge, by a piece of dishonourable conduct towards him\u2014that hearing of my melancholy situation, he had come with an intention of offering his assistance and comfort, and was ready to espouse my quarrel, and forthwith take vengeance on my seducer, provided I would grant him one consideration, which, he hoped, I should see no reason to refuse. Had all the artifice of hell been employed in composing a persuasive, it could not have had a more instantaneous or favourable effect than this discourse had upon me. I was transported with a delirium of gloomy joy. The contract was made; he devoted himself to my revenge, undertook to murder Lothario that very night, and to bring me an account of his death before morning. Accordingly, about two of the clock, he was introduced to my chamber, and assured me that my perfidious lover was no more: that although he was not entitled to such an honourable proceeding, he had fairly challenged him to the field, where he upbraided him with his treachery towards me, for whom, he told me, his sword was drawn, and after a few passes left him weltering in his blood. I was so savaged by my wrongs, that I delighted in the recital of this adventure, made him repeat the particulars and feasted my eyes on the blood that remained on his clothes and sword. My imagination was so engrossed by these ideas, that in my sleep I dreamed Lothario appeared before me pale, mangled, and bloody, blamed my rashness, protested his innocence, and pleaded his cause so pathetically, that I was convinced of his fidelity, and waked in a fit of horror and remorse. I dropped asleep again, and the same apparition recurred to my fancy. In short, I passed the night in great misery, and looked upon my avenger with such abhorrence, that in the morning, perceiving my aversion, he insinuated there was still a possibility of Lothario\u2019s recovery: it was quite true he left him wounded on the ground, but not quite dead, and perhaps his hurts might not be mortal. At these words I started up, bade him fly for intelligence, and if he could not bring me tidings of Lothario\u2019s safety, at least consult his own, and never return; for I was resolved to surrender myself to justice, and declare all I knew of the affair, that, if possible I might expiate my own guilt, by incurring the rigours of a sincere repentance and ignominious death. He very coolly represented the unreasonableness of my prejudice against him, who had done nothing but what his love of me inspired, and honour justified: that now he had, at the risk of his life, been subservient to my revenge, I was about to discard him as an infamous agent, occasionally necessary; and that, even if he should be so lucky as to bring news of Lothario\u2019s safety, it was probable my former resentment might revive, and I would upbraid him with having failed in his undertaking. I assured him, that on the contrary, he should be dearer to me than ever, as I then should be convinced he acted more on the principles of a man of honour than on those of a mercenary assassin, and scorned to take away the life of an adversary, how inveterate soever, which fortune had put in his power. \u201cWell, then madam,\u201d said he, \u201cwhatever may have happened, I shall find it no difficult matter to acquit myself in point of honour;\u201d and took his leave in order to inquire into the consequences of his duel. I was now more sensible than ever of the degrees of guilt and misery; all the affliction I had suffered hitherto was owing to my own credulity and weakness, and my conscience could only accuse me of venial crimes; but now that I looked upon myself as a murderer, it is impossible to express the terrors of my imagination, which was incessantly haunted by the image of the deceased, and my bosom stung with the most exquisite agonies, of which I saw no end. At length, Horatio (for so I shall call my new friend) returned, and telling me I had nothing to fear, delivered into my hands a billet containing these words.\n\n\u201cMadam,\n    \u201cAs I understand it is of consequence to your peace, I take this liberty to inform you, that the wounds I received from Horatio are not mortal. This satisfaction my humanity could not deny, even to a person who has endeavoured to disturb the repose as well as the life of\n\n\u201cLothario.\u201d\n\n\u2018Being well acquainted with this hand, I had no reason to suspect an imposition in this letter, which I read over and over with a transport of joy, and caressed Horatio so much that he appeared the happiest man alive. Thus was I won from despair by the menaces of a greater misfortune than that which depressed me. Griefs are like usurpers,\u2014the most powerful deposes all the rest. But my raptures were not lasting: that very letter which in a manner re-established my tranquillity, in a little time banished my peace. His unjust reproaches, while they waked my resentment, recalled my former happiness, and filled my soul with rage and sorrow. Horatio, perceiving the situation of my mind, endeavoured to divert my chagrin, by treating me with all the amusements and entertainments of the town. I was gratified with every indulgence I could desire; introduced into the company of women in my own situation, by whom an uncommon deference was paid to me; and I began to lose all remembrance of my former condition, when an accident brought it back to my view with all its interesting circumstances. Diverting myself one day with some newspapers, which I had not before perused, the following advertisement attracted my attention:\n\n\u2018\u201cWhereas a young gentlewoman disappeared from her father\u2019s house in the county of \u2014, about the end of September, on account (as is supposed) of some uneasiness of mind, and has not been as yet heard of. Whoever will give any information about her to Mr. \u2014 of Gray\u2019s Inn, shall be handsomely rewarded; or if she will return to the arms of her disconsolate parent, she will be received with the utmost tenderness, whatever reason she may have to think otherwise, and may be the means of prolonging the life of a father already weighed down almost to the grave with age and sorrow.\u201d\n\n\u2018This pathetic remonstrance had such an effect on me, that I was fully resolved to return, like the prodigal son, and implore the forgiveness of him who gave me life; but, alas! Upon inquiry, I found he had paid his debt to nature a month before, lamenting my absence to his last hour, having left his fortune to a stranger, as a mark of his resentment of my unkind and undutiful behaviour. Penetrated with remorse on this occasion, I sank into the most profound melancholy, and considered myself as the immediate cause of his death. I lost all relish for company; and, indeed, most of my acquaintances no sooner perceived my change of temper, than they abandoned me. Horatio, disgusted at my insensibility, or from some other cause, became colder and colder every day, till at last he left me altogether, without making any apology for his conduct, or securing me against the miseries of want, as a man of honour ought to have done, considering the share he had in my ruin; for I afterwards learned, that the quarrel between Lothario and him was a story trumped up to rid the one of my importunities, and give the other a recommendation to me, which, it seems, he desired, upon seeing me at the house of my seducer. Reduced to this extremity, I cursed my own simplicity, uttered horrid imprecations against the treachery of Horatio; and, as I became every day more and more familiarised to the loss of innocence, resolved to be revenged on the sex in general, by practising their own arts upon themselves. Nor was an opportunity long wanting: an old gentlewoman, under pretence of sympathising, visited me, and after having condoled me on my misfortunes, and professed a disinterested friendship, began to display the art of her occupation, in encomiums on my beauty, and invectives against the wretch who had forsaken me; insinuating withal, that it would be my own fault if I did not still make my fortune by the extraordinary qualifications with which nature had endowed me. I soon understood her drift, and gave her such encouragement to explain herself, that we came to an agreement immediately to divide whatever profits might accrue from such gallants as she should introduce to my acquaintance. The first stroke of my dissimulation was practised upon a certain judge, to whom I was recommended by this matron as an innocent creature just arrived from the country.\u2019\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nMiss Williams interrupted by a bailiff, who carries her to the Marshalsea\u2014I accompany her\u2014prove she is not the person named in the writ\u2014the bailiff is fain to discharge her\u2014we shift our lodging\u2014her story, and my reflections thereupon\u2014progress of a common woman of the town\u2014resolves to quit that way of life\n\nHer story was here interrupted by a rap at the door, which I no sooner opened, than three or four terrible fellows rushed in, one of whom accosted my fellow-lodger thus: \u201cMadam, your servant\u2014you must do me the favour to come along with me, I have a writ against you.\u201d While the bailiff (for so he was) spoke thus, his followers surrounded the prisoner, and began to handle her very roughly. This treatment incensed me so much, that I snatched up the poker and would certainly have used it in defence of the lady, without any regard to the strength and number of her adversaries, had she not begged me, with a composure of countenance for which I could not account, to use no violence on her behalf, which could be of no service to her, but might be very detrimental to myself. Then turning to the leader of this formidable troop, she desired to see the writ, and having perused it, said with a faltering voice, \u201cI am not the person whose name is here mentioned, arrest me at your peril.\u201d \u201cAy, ay, madam,\u201d replied the catchpole. \u201cWe shall prove your identity. In the meantime, whither will you be pleased to be carried, to my house, or to jail?\u201d \u201cIf I must be confined,\u201d said she, \u201cI would rather be in your house than in a common jail.\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d answered he, \u201cif you have money enough in your pocket, you shall be entertained like a princess.\u201d But when she acquainted him with her poverty, he swore he never gave credit, and ordered one of his myrmidons to call a coach, to carry her to the Marshalsea at once. While they waited for the convenience, she took me aside, and bade me be under no concern on her account, for she knew how to extricate herself from this difficulty very soon, and perhaps gain something by the occasion. Although her discourse was a mystery to me, I was very well pleased with her assurance; and when the coach came to the door, I offered to accompany her to prison, to which proposal, after much entreaty, she consented.\n\nWhen we arrived at the gate of the Marshalsea, our conductor alighted, and having demanded entrance, presented the writ to the turnkey, who no sooner perceived the name of Elizabeth Cary than he cried, \u201cAh, ah: my old acquaintance Bet! I\u2019m glad to see thee with all my heart.\u201d So saying, he opened the coach door, and helped her to dismount; but when he observed her face, he started back, saying, \u201cWho have we got here?\u201d The bailiff, alarmed at this interrogation, cried with some emotion, \u201cWho should it be but the prisoner, Elizabeth Cary?\u201d The turnkey replied, \u201cThat Elizabeth Cary! I\u2019ll be hanged if that\u2019s Elizabeth Cary more than my grandmother.\u201d Here the lady thought fit to interpose, and tell the catchpole, if he had taken her word for it at first, he might have saved himself and her a great deal of trouble. \u201cIt may be so,\u201d answered he, \u201cbut I\u2019ll have further evidence that you are not the person, before you and I part.\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d said she, \u201cyou shall have further evidence, to your cost.\u201d Then we adjourned into the lodge, and called for a bottle of wine, where my companion wrote a direction to two of her acquaintance, and begged the favour of me to go to their lodgings, and request them to come to her immediately. I found them together at a house in Brydges Street, Drury Lane, and as they were luckily unengaged, they set out with me in a hackney-coach without hesitation, after I had related the circumstances of the affair, which flattered them with the hopes of seeing a bailiff trounced; for there is an antipathy as natural between women of that class and bailiffs, as that subsisting between mice and cats. Accordingly, when they entered the lodge, they embraced the prisoner very affectionately by the name of Nancy Williams, and asked how long she had been nabbed, and for what? On hearing the particulars of her adventure repeated, they offered to swear before a justice of peace that she was not the person mentioned in the writ, whom, it seems, they all knew; but the bailiff, who was by the time convinced of his mistake, told them he would not put them to that trouble. \u201cLadies,\u201d said he, \u201cthere\u2019s no harm done\u2014you shall give me leave to treat you with another bottle, and then we\u2019ll part friends.\u201d This proposal was not at all relished by the sisterhood: and Miss Williams told him, sure he did not imagine her such a fool as to be satisfied with a paltry glass of sour wine? Here the turnkey interrupted her by affirming with an oath, that the wine was as good as ever was tipped over tongue. \u201cWell,\u201d continued she, \u201cthat may be, but were it the best of champagne, it is no recompense for the damage I have suffered both in character and health, by being wrongfully dragged to jail; at this rate, no innocent person is safe, since an officer of justice, out of malice, private pique, or mistake, may injure and oppress the subject with impunity; but, thank heaven, I live under the protection of laws that will not suffer such insults to pass unpunished, and I know very well how to procure redress.\u201d Mr. Vulture, for that was the bailiff\u2019s name, finding he had to deal with one who would not be imposed upon, began to look very sullen and perplexed, and, leaning his forehead on his hand, entered into a deliberation with himself, which lasted a few minutes, and then broke out in a volley of dreadful curses against the old jade our landlady, as he called her, for having misinformed him. After much wrangling and swearing, the matter was referred to the decision of the turnkey, who calling for the other bottle, mulcted the bailiff in all the liquor that had been drunk, coach hire, and a couple of guineas for the use of the plaintiff. The money was immediately deposited; Miss Williams gratified the two evidences with one half, and putting the other in her pocket drove home with me, leaving the catchpole grumbling over his loss, yet pleased in the main, for having so cheaply got clear of a business that might have cost him ten times the sum, and his place to boot. This guinea was a very seasonable relief to us, who were reduced to great necessity, six of my shirts, and almost all my clothes, except those on my back, having been either pawned or sold for our maintenance before this happened. As we resented the behaviour of our landlady, our first care was to provide ourselves with another lodging, whither we removed next day, with an intention to keep ourselves as retired as possible, until our cure should be completed. When we were fixed in our new habitation, I entreated her to finish the story of her life, which she pursued in this manner:\u2014\n\n\u2018The success of our experiment on the judge encouraged us to practice the same deceit on others; but this harvest lasted not long, my character taking air, and my directress deserting me for some new game. Then I took lodgings near Charing-Cross, at two guineas a week, and began to entertain company in a public manner; but my income being too small to defray my expenses, I was obliged to retrench, and enter into articles with the porters of certain taverns, who undertook to find employment enough for me, provided I would share my profits with them. Accordingly, I was almost every night engaged with company, among whom I was exposed to every mortification, danger, and abuse, that flow from drunkenness and brutality. As my spirit was not sufficiently humbled to the will, nor my temper calculated for the conversation of my gallants, it was impossible for me to overcome an aversion I felt for my profession, which manifested itself in a settled gloom on my countenance, and disgusted those sons of mirth and riot so much, that I was frequently used in a shocking manner, and kicked down stairs with disgrace. The messengers, seeing me disagreeable to their benefactors and employers, seldom troubled me with a call, and I began to find myself almost totally neglected.\n\n\u2018To contribute towards my support I was fain to sell my watch, rings, trinkets, with the best part of my clothes; and I was one evening musing by myself on misery before me when I received a message from a tavern, whither I repaired in a chair, and was introduced to a gentleman dressed like an officer, with whom I supped in a sumptuous manner. In the morning, when I awoke, I found my gallant had got up, and, drawing aside the curtain, could not perceive him in the room. I waited a full hour for his return, and then in the greatest perplexity, rose up and rang the bell. When the waiter came to the door, he found it locked, and desired admittance, which I granted, after observing, with great surprise, that the key remained on the inside, as when we went to bed. I no sooner inquired for the captain, than the fellow, staring with a distracted look, cried, \u201cHow, madam, is he not abed?\u201d And when he was satisfied as to that particular, ran into a closet adjoining to the chamber, the window of which he found open. Through this the adventurer had got upon a wall, front whence he dropped down into a court and escaped, leaving me to be answerable not only for the reckoning, but also for a large silver tankard and posset-bowl, which he had carried off with him.\n\n\u2018It is impossible to describe the consternation I was under, when I saw myself detained as a thief\u2019s accomplice; for I was looked upon in that light, and carried before a justice, who mistaking my confusion for a sign of guilt committed me, after a short examination, to Bridewell, having admonished me, as the only means to save my life, to turn evidence, and impeach my confederate. I now concluded the vengeance of Heaven had overtaken me, and that I must soon finish my career by an ignominious death. This reflection sank so deep into my soul, that I was for some days deprived of my reason, and actually believed myself in hell, tormented by fiends. Indeed, there needs not a very extravagant imagination to form that idea: for of all the scenes on earth that of Bridewell approaches nearest the notion I had always entertained of the regions. Here I saw nothing but rage, anguish and impiety, and heard nothing but groans, curses, and blasphemy. In the midst of this hellish crew, I was subjected to the tyranny of a barbarian, who imposed upon me tasks that I could not possibly perform, and then punished my incapacity with the utmost rigour and inhumanity. I was often whipped into a swoon, and lashed out of it (during which miserable interval, I was robbed by my fellow-prisoners of everything about me, even to my cap, shoes, and stockings): I was not only destitute of necessaries, but even of food, so that my wretchedness was extreme. Not one of my acquaintance to whom I imparted my situation, would grant me the least succour or regard, on pretence of my being committed for theft, and my landlord refused to part with some of my own clothes which I sent for, because I was indebted to him for a week\u2019s lodging.\n\n\u2018Overwhelmed with calamity, I grew desperate, and resolved to put an end to my grievances and life together: for this purpose I got up in the middle of the night, when I thought everybody around me asleep, and fixing one end of a large hook in the ceiling, that supported the scales on which the hemp is weighed, I stood upon a chair, and making a noose on the other end, put my neck into it, with an intention to hang myself; but before I could adjust the knot I was surprised and prevented by two women, who had been awake all the while and suspected my design. In the morning, my attempt was published among the prisoners and punished with thirty stripes, the pain of which, co-operating with my disappointment and disgrace, bereft me of my senses, and threw me into an ecstacy of madness, during which I tore the flesh from my bones with my teeth, and dashed my head against the pavement; so that they were obliged to set a watch over me, to restrain me from doing further mischief to myself and others. This fit of frenzy continued three days, at the end of which I grew calm and sullen: but as the desire of making away with myself still remained, I came to a determination of starving myself to death, and with that view refused all sustenance.\n\n\u2018Whether it was owing to the want of opposition, or to the weakness of nature, I know not; but on the second day of my fast, I found my resolution considerably impaired, and the calls of hunger almost insupportable. At this critical conjuncture a lady was brought into the prison, with whom I had contracted an acquaintance while I lived with Horatio; she was then on the same footing as I was, but afterwards quarrelling with her gallant, and not finding another to her mind, altered her scheme of life, and set up a coffee-house among the hundreds in Drury, where she entertained gentlemen with claret, arrack, and the choice of half-a-dozen damsels who lived in her house. This serviceable matron having neglected to gratify a certain justice for the connivance she enjoyed, was indicted at the quarter sessions, in consequence of which her bevy was dispersed, and herself committed to Bridewell. She had not been long there before she learned my disaster, and coming up to me, after a compliment of condolence, inquired into the particulars of my fate. While we were engaged in discourse together, the master came and told me, that the fellow on whose account I had suffered was taken, that he had confessed the theft, and cleared me of any concern in the affair; for which reason he, the master, had orders to discharge me, and that I was from that moment free.\n\n\u2018This piece of news soon banished all thoughts of death, and had such an instantaneous effect on my countenance, that Mrs. Coupler (the lady then present), hoping to find her account in me, very generously offered to furnish me with what necessaries I wanted, and take me into her own house as soon as she could compromise matters with the justices. The conditions of her offer were, that I should pay three guineas weekly for my board, and a reasonable consideration besides, for the use of such clothes and ornaments as she should supply me with, to be deducted from the first profits of my occupation. These were hard terms, but not to be rejected by one who was turned out helpless and naked into the wide world, without a friend to pity or assist her. I therefore embraced her proposal, and she being bailed in a few hours, took me home with her in a coach. As I was by this time conscious of having formerly disgusted my admirers by my reserved loud haughty behaviour, I now endeavoured to conquer that disposition, and the sudden change of my fortune giving me a flow of spirits, I appeared in the most winning and gay manner I could assume. Having the advantage of a good voice and education, I exerted my talents to the uttermost, and soon became the favourite with all company. This success alarmed the pride and jealousy of Mrs. Coupler, who could not bear the thoughts of being eclipsed: she therefore made a merit of her envy, and whispered among the customers that I was unsound. There needed no more to ruin my reputation and blast my prosperity; everybody shunned me with marks of aversion and disdain, and in a very short time I was as solitary as ever. Want of gallants was attended with want of money to satisfy my malicious landlady, who having purposely given me credit to the amount of eleven pounds, took out a writ against me and I was arrested in her own house. Though the room was crowded with people when the bailiff entered, not one of them had compassion enough to mollify my prosecutrix, far less to pay the debt; they even laughed at my tears, and one of them bade me be of good cheer, for I should not want admirers in Newgate.\n\n\u2018At this instant a sea-lieutenant came in, and seeing my plight, began to inquire into the circumstances of my misfortune. \u201cHarkee, my girl,\u201d he inquired \u201chow far have you overrun the constable?\u201d I told him that the debt amounted to eleven pounds, besides the expenses of the writ. \u201cAn that be all,\u201d said he, \u201cyou shan\u2019t go to the bilboes this bout.\u201d And taking out his purse, he paid the money, discharged the bailiff, and telling me I had got into the wrong port, advised me to seek out a more convenient harbour, where I could be safely hove down; for which purpose he made me a present of five guineas more. I was so touched with this singular piece of generosity, that for some time I had not power to thank him. However, as soon as I recollected myself, I begged the favour of him to go with me to the next tavern, where I explained the nature of my disaster, and convinced him of the falsehood of what was reported to my prejudice so effectually, that he from that moment attached himself to me, and we lived in great harmony together, until he was obliged to go to sea, where he perished in a storm.\n\n\u2018Having lost my benefactor, and almost consumed the remains of his bounty, I saw myself in danger of relapsing into my former necessity, and began to be very uneasy at the prospect of bailiffs and jails! when one of the sisterhood advised me to take lodgings in a part of the town where I was unknown, and pass for an heiress, by which artifice I might entrap somebody to be my husband, who would possibly be able to allow me a handsome maintenance, or at worst screen me from the dread and danger of a prison, by becoming liable for whatever debts I should contract. I approved of this scheme, towards the execution of which my companion clubbed her wardrobe, and undertook to live with me in quality of my maid, with the proviso that she should be reimbursed and handsomely considered out of the profits of my success. She was immediately detached to look out for a convenient place, and that very day hired a genteel apartment in Park Street, whither I moved in a couch loaded with her baggage, and my own. I made my first appearance in a blue riding habit trimmed with silver; and my maid acted her part so artfully, that in a day or two my fame spread all over the neighbourhood, and I was said to be a rich heiress just arrived from the country. This report brought a swarm of gay young fellows about me; but I soon found them to be all indigent adventurers like myself, who crowded to me like crows to a carrion, with a view of preying upon my fortune. I maintained, however, the appearance of wealth as long as possible, in hopes of gaining some admirer more for my purpose, and at length attracted the regard of one who would have satisfied my wishes, and managed matters so well, that a day was actually fixed for our nuptials. In the interim, he begged leave to introduce an intimate friend to me, which request, as I could not refuse, I had the extreme mortification and surprise to see, next night, in that friend, my old keeper Horatio, who no sooner beheld me than he changed colour, but had presence of mind to advance and salute me, bidding me (with a low voice) be under no apprehension, for he would not expose me. In spite of his assurance, I could not recover myself so far as to entertain them, but withdrew to my chamber on pretence of a severe headache, to the no small concern of my adorer, who took his leave in the tenderest manner, and went off with his friend.\n\n\u2018Having imparted my situation to my companion, she found it high time for us to decamp, and that without any noise, because we were not only indebted to our landlady, but also to several tradesmen in the neighbourhood. Our retreat, therefore, was concerted and executed in this manner: Having packed up all our clothes and moveables in small parcels, she (on pretence of fetching cordials for me) carried them at several times to the house of an acquaintance, where she likewise procured a lodging, to which we retired in the middle of the night, when every other body in the house was asleep. I was now obliged to aim at lower game, and accordingly spread my nets among tradespeople, but found them all too phlegmatic or cautious for my art and attractions, till at last I became acquainted with you, on whom I practised all my dexterity; not that I believed you had any fortune, or expectation of me, but that I might transfer the burden of such debts as I had incurred, or should contract, from myself to another, and at the same time avenge myself of your sex, by rendering miserable one who bore such resemblance to the wretch who ruined me; but Heaven preserved you from my snares by the discovery you made, which was owing to the negligence of my maid in leaving the chamber-door unlocked when she went to buy sugar for breakfast. When I found myself detected and forsaken by you, I was fain to move my lodging, and dwell two pair of stairs higher than before. My companion, being disappointed in her expectations, left me, and I had no other resource than to venture forth, like the owls in the dark, to pick up a precarious and uncomfortable subsistence. I have often sauntered between Ludgate Hill and Charing Cross a whole winter night, exposed not only to the inclemency of the weather, but likewise to the rage of hunger and thirst, without being so happy as to meet with one dupe, then creep up to my garret, in a deplorable draggled condition, sneak to bed, and try to bury my appetite and sorrows in sleep. When I lighted on some rake or tradesman reeling home drunk, I frequently suffered the most brutal treatment, in spite of which I was obliged to affect gaiety and good humour, though my soul was stung with resentment and disdain, and my heart loaded with grief and affliction. In the course of these nocturnal adventures, I was infected with the disease, that in a short time rendered me the object of my own abhorrence, and drove me to the retreat where your benevolence rescued me from the jaws of death.\u2019\n\nSo much candour and good sense appeared in this lady\u2019s narration, that I made no scruple of believing every syllable of what she said, and expressed my astonishment at the variety of miseries she had undergone in so little time, for all her misfortunes had happened within the compass of two years; I compared her situation with my own, and found it a thousand times more wretched. I had endured hardships, \u2019tis true\u2014my whole life had been a series of such; and when I looked forward, the prospect was not much bettered, but then they were become habitual to me, and consequently I could bear them with less difficulty. If one scheme of life should not succeed, I could have recourse to another, and so to a third, veering about to a thousand different shifts, according to the emergencies of my fate, without forfeiting the dignity of my character beyond a power of retrieving it, or subjecting myself wholly to the caprice and barbarity of the world. On the other hand, she had known and relished the sweets of prosperity, she had been brought up under the wings of an indulgent parent, in all the delicacies to which her sex and rank entitled her; and without any extravagance of hope, entertained herself with the view of uninterrupted happiness through the whole scene of life. How fatal then, how tormenting, how intolerable, must her reverse of fortune be!\u2014a reverse, that not only robs her of these external comforts, and plunges her into all the miseries of want, but also murders her peace of mind, and entails upon her the curse of eternal infamy! Of all professions I pronounced that of a courtesan the most deplorable, and her of all courtesans the most unhappy. She allowed my observation to be just in the main, but at the same time affirmed that notwithstanding the disgraces which had fallen to her share, she had not been so unlucky in the condition of a prostitute as many others of the same community. \u201cI have often seen,\u201d said she, \u201cwhile I strolled about the streets at midnight, a number of naked wretches reduced to rags and filth, huddled together like swine, in the corner of a dark alley, some of whom, but eighteen months before, I had known the favourites of the town, rolling in affluence, and glittering in all the pomp of equipage and dress. Miserable wretch that I am! perhaps the same horrors are decreed for me!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d cried she, after some pause, \u201cI shall never live to such extremity of distress; my own hand shall open a way for my deliverance, before I arrive at that forlorn period!\u201d Her condition filled me with sympathy and compassion: I revered her qualifications, looked upon her as unfortunate, not criminal, and attended her with such care and success, that in less than two months her health, as well as my own, was perfectly re-established. As we often conferred upon our mutual affairs, and interchanged advice, a thousand different projects were formed, which, upon further canvassing, appeared impracticable. We would have gladly gone to service, but who would take us in without recommendation? At length an expedient occurred to her, of which she intended to lay hold; and this was, to procure with the first money she should earn, the homely garb of a country wench, go to some village at a good distance from town, and come up in a waggon, as a fresh girl for service: by which means she might be provided for, in a manner much more suitable to her inclination than her present way of life.\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nI am reduced to a great misery\u2014assaulted on Tower Hill by a press-gang, who put me on board a tender\u2014my usage there\u2014my arrival on board at a man-of-war, where I am put in irons, and released by the good offices of Mr. Thompson, who recommends me as assistant to the surgeon\u2014-he relates his own story\u2014characters of the captain, surgeon, and first mate\n\nI applauded the resolution of Miss Williams, who a few days after, was hired in quality of bar-keeper, by one of the ladies who had witnessed in her behalf at the Marshalsea, and who since that time had got credit with a wine merchant, whose favourite she was, to set up a convenient house of her own. Thither my fellow-lodger repaired, after having taken leave of me with a torrent of tears, and a thousand protestations of eternal gratitude; assuring me she would remain in this situation no longer than she could pick up money sufficient to put her other design in execution.\n\nAs for my own part, I saw no resource but the army or navy, between which I hesitated so long that I found myself reduced to a starving condition. My spirit began to accommodate itself to my beggarly fate, and I became so mean as to go down towards Wapping, with an intention to inquire for an old schoolfellow, who, I understood, had got the command of a small coasting vessel then in the river, and implore his assistance. But my destiny prevented this abject piece of behaviour; for as I crossed Tower Wharf, a squat tawny fellow with a hanger by his side, and a cudgel in his hand came up to me, calling, \u201cYo ho! brother, you must come along with me.\u201d As I did not like his appearance, instead of answering his salutation, I quickened my pace, in hope of ridding myself of his company; upon which he whistled aloud, and immediately another sailor appeared before me, who laid hold of me by the collar, and began to drag me along. Not being in a humour to relish such treatment, I disengaged myself of the assailant, and, with one blow of my cudgel, laid him motionless on the ground; and perceiving myself surrounded in a trice by ten or a dozen more, exerted myself with such dexterity and success, that some of my opponents were fain to attack me with drawn cutlasses; and after an obstinate engagement, in which I received a large wound on my head, and another on my left cheek, I was disarmed, taken prisoner, and carried on board a pressing tender, where, after being pinioned like a malefactor, I was thrust down into the hold among a parcel of miserable wretches, the sight of whom well nigh distracted me. As the commanding officer had not humanity enough to order my wounds to be dressed, and I could not use my own hands, I desired one of my fellow captives who was unfettered, to take a handkerchief out of my pocket, and tie it round my head, to stop the bleeding. He pulled out my handkerchief, \u2019tis true, but instead of applying it to the use for which I designed it, went to the grating of the hatchway, and, with astonishing composure, sold it before my face to a bumboat woman (1) then on board, for a quart of gin, with which he treated his companions, regardless of my circumstances and entreaties.\n\n(1) A Bumboat woman is one who sells bread, cheese, greens, liquor, and fresh potatoes to the sailors, in a small boat that lies alongside the ship\n\nI complained bitterly of this robbery to the midshipman on deck, telling him at the same time, that unless my hurts were dressed, I should bleed to death. But compassion was a weakness of which no man could justly accuse this person, who, squirting a mouthful of dissolved tobacco upon me through the gratings, told me \u201cI was a mutinous dog, and that I might die for anything he cared!\u201d Finding there was no other remedy, I appealed to patience, and laid up this usage in my memory, to be called at a more fitting opportunity. In the meantime, loss of blood, vexation, and want of food, contributed, with the noisome stench of the place, to throw me into a swoon, out of which I was recovered by a tweak of the nose, administered by the tar who stood sentinel over us, who at the same time regaled me with a draught of flip, and comforted me with the hopes of being put on board of the Thunder next day, where I should be freed of my handcuffs, and cured of my wounds by the doctor. I no sooner heard him name the Thunder, than I asked if he had belonged to that ship long; and be giving me to understand he had belonged to her five years, I inquired if he knew Lieutenant Bowling? \u201cKnow Lieutenant Bowling!\u201d said he, \u201cOdds my life! and that I do; and a good seaman he is as ever stepped upon forecastle, and a brave fellow as ever cracked biscuit\u2014none of your Guinea pigs, nor your fresh water, wish-washy, fair-weather fowls. Many a taut gale of wind have honest Tom Bowling and I weathered together. Here\u2019s his health, with all my heart: wherever he is, a-loft, or a-low, the lieutenant needs not be ashamed to show himself.\u201d I was so much affected with this eulogium, that I could not refrain from telling him that I was Lieutenant Bowling\u2019s kinsman; in consequence of which connection, he expressed his inclination to serve me, and when he was relieved, brought some cold boiled beef in a platter, and biscuit, on which we supped plentifully, and afterwards drank another can of flip together. While we were thus engaged, he recounted a great many exploits of my uncle, who, I found, was very much beloved by the ship\u2019s company, and pitied for the misfortune that had happened to him in Hispaniola, which I was very glad to be informed was not so great as I imagined; for Captain Oakum had recovered of his wounds, and actually at that time commanded the ship. Having by accident, in my pocket, my uncle\u2019s letter, written from Port Louis, I gave it my benefactor (whose name was Jack Rattlin) for his perusal; but honest Jack told me frankly he could not read, and desired to know the contents, which I immediately communicated. When he heard that part of it in which he says he had written to his landlord in Deal, he cried, \u201cBody o\u2019 me! that was old Ben Block; he was dead before the letter came to hand. Ey, ey, had Ben been alive, Lieutenant Bowling would have had no occasion to skulk so long. Honest Ben was the first man that taught him to hand, reef, and steer. Well, well, we must all die, that\u2019s certain\u2014we must all come to port sooner or later, at sea or on shore\u2014we must be fast moored one day: death\u2019s like the best bower anchor, as the saying is\u2014it will bring us all up.\u201d I could not but signify my approbation of the justness of Jack\u2019s reflections, and inquired into the occasion of the quarrel between Captain Oakum and my uncle, which he explained in this manner: \u201cCaptain Oakum, to be sure, is a good man enough\u2014besides, he\u2019s my commander; but what\u2019s that to me? I do my duty, and value no man\u2019s anger of a rope\u2019s end. Now the report goes, as how he\u2019s a lord, or baron knight\u2019s brother, whereby (d\u2019ye see me,) he carries a straight arm, and keeps aloof from his officers, though mayhap they may be as good men in the main as he. Now we lying at anchor in Tuberon Bay, Lieutenant Bowling had the middle watch, and as he always kept a good look out, he made (d\u2019ye see) three lights in the offing, whereby he ran down to the great cabin for orders, and found the captain asleep; whereupon he waked him, which put him in a main high passion, and he swore woundily at the lieutenant, and called him lousy Scotch son of a whore (for, I being then sentinel in the steerage, heard all), and swab, and lubber, whereby the lieutenant returned the salute, and they jawed together fore and aft a good spell, till at last the captain turned out, and, laying hold of a rattan, came athwart Mr. Bowling\u2019s quarter: whereby he told the captain that, if he was not his commander, he would heave him overboard, and demanded satisfaction ashore; whereby in the morning watch, the captain went ashore in the pinnace, and afterwards the lieutenant carried the cutter ashore, and so they, leaving the boats\u2019 crews on their oars, went away together; and so (d\u2019ye see) in less than a quarter of an hour we heard firing, whereby we made for the place, and found the captain lying wounded on the beach, and so brought him on board to the doctor, who cured him in less than six weeks. But the lieutenant clapped on all the sail he could bear, and had got far enough ahead before we knew anything of the matter; so that we could never after get sight of him, for which we were not sorry, because the captain was mainly wrath, and would certainly have done him a mischief; for he afterwards caused him to be run on the ship\u2019s books, whereby he lost all his pay, and, if he should be taken, would be tried as a deserter.\u201d\n\nThis account of the captain\u2019s behaviour gave me no advantageous idea of his character; and I could not help lamenting my own fate, that had subjected me to such a commander. However, making a virtue of necessity, I put a good face on the matter, and next day, was, with the other pressed men, put on board of the \u201cThunder,\u201d lying at the Nore. When we came alongside, the mate, who guarded us thither, ordered my handcuffs to be taken off, that I might get on board the easier; this circumstance being perceived by some of the company who stood upon the gangboard to see us enter, one of them called to Jack Rattlin, who was busied in doing this friendly office for me, \u201cHey, Jack, what Newgate galley have you boarded in the river as you came along? Have we not thieves enow among us already?\u201d Another, observing my wounds, which remained exposed to the air, told me, my seams were uncaulked, and that I must be new payed. A third, seeing my hair clotted together with blood, as it were into distinct cords, took notice, that my bows were mended with the red ropes, instead of my side. A fourth asked me, if I could not keep my yards square without iron braces? And, in short, a thousand witticisms of the same nature were passed upon me before I could get up the ship\u2019s side.\n\nAfter we had been all entered upon the ship\u2019s books, I inquired of one of my shipmates where the surgeon was, that I might have my wounds dressed, and had actually got as far as the middle deck (for our ship carried eighty guns), in my way to the cockpit, when I was met by the same midshipman who had used me so barbarously in the tender: he, seeing me free from my chains, asked, with an insolent air, who had released me? To this question, I foolishly answered, with a countenance that too plainly declared the state of my thoughts, \u201cWhoever did it, I am persuaded did not consult you in the affair.\u201d I had no sooner uttered these words, than he cried, \u201cDamn you, you saucy son of a hitch, I\u2019ll teach you to talk so to your officer.\u201d So saying, he bestowed on me several severe stripes with a supple jack he had in his hand: and, going to the commanding officer, made such a report of me, that I was immediately put in irons by the master-at-arms, and a sentinel placed over me. Honest Rattlin, as soon as he heard of my condition, came to me, and administered all the consolation he could, and then went to the surgeon in my behalf, who sent one of his mates to dress my wounds. This mate was no other than my old friend Thompson, with whom I became acquainted at the Navy Office, as before mentioned. If I knew him at first sight, it was not easy for him to recognise me, disfigured with blood and dirt, and altered by the misery I had undergone. Unknown as I was to him, he surveyed me with looks of compassion, and handled my sores with great tenderness. When he had applied what he thought proper, and was about to leave me, I asked him if my misfortunes had disguised me so much that he could not recollect my face? Upon this address he observed me with great earnestness for some time, and at length protested he could not recollect one feature of my countenance. To keep him no longer in suspense, I told him my name, which when he heard, he embraced me with affection, and professed his sorrow at seeing me in such a disagreeable situation. I made him acquainted with my story, and, when he heard how inhumanly I had been used in the tender, he left me abruptly, assuring me I should see him again soon. I had scarce time to wonder at his sudden departure, when the master-at-arms came to the place of my confinement, and bade me follow him to the quarter-deck, where I was examined by the first lieutenant, who commanded the ship in the absence of the captain, touching the treatment I had received in the tender from my friend the midshipman, who was present to confront me.\n\nI recounted the particulars of his behaviour to me, not only in the tender, but since my being on board the ship, part of which being proved by the evidence of Jack Rattlin and others, who had no great devotion for my oppressor, I was discharged from confinement, to make way for him, who was delivered to the master-at-arms to take his turn in the bilboes. And this was not the only satisfaction I enjoyed, for I was, at the request of the surgeon, exempted from all other duty than that of assisting his mates, in making and administering medicines to the sick. This good office I owed to the friendship of Mr. Thompson, who had represented me in such a favourable light to the surgeon, that he demanded me of the lieutenant to supply the place of his third mate, who was lately dead. When I had obtained this favour, my friend Thompson carried me down to the cockpit, which is the place allotted for the habitation of the surgeon\u2019s mates; and when he had shown me their berth (as he called it), I was filled with astonishment and horror, We descended by divers ladders to a space as dark as a dungeon, which, I understood, was immersed several feet under water, being immediately above the hold. I had no sooner approached this dismal gulph, than my nose was saluted with an intolerable stench of putrified cheese and rancid butter, that issued from an apartment at the foot of the ladder, resembling a chandler\u2019s shop, where, by the faint glimmering of a candle, I could perceive a man with a pale, meagre countenance, sitting behind a kind of desk, having spectacles on his nose, and a pen in his hand. This (I learned of Mr. Thompson) was the ship\u2019s steward, who sat there to distribute provision to the several messes, and to mark what each received. He therefore presented my name to him, and desired I might be entered in his mess; then, taking a light in his hand, conducted me to the place of his residence, which was a square of about six feet, surrounded with the medicine-chest, that of the first mate, his own, and a board by way of table fastened to the after powder room; it was also inclosed with canvas nailed round to the beams of the ship, to screen us from the cold, as well as from the view of the midshipmen and quartermaster, who lodged within the cable-tiers on each side of us. In this gloomy mansion he entertained me with some cold suit pork, which he brought from a sort of locker, fixed above the table: and calling for the boy of the mess, sent for a can of beer, of which he made excellent flip to crown the banquet.\n\nBy this time I began to recover my spirits, which had been exceedingly depressed with the appearance of everything about me, and could no longer refrain from asking the particulars of Mr. Thompson\u2019s fortune since I had seen him in London. He told me, that being disappointed in his expectations of borrowing money to gratify the rapacious s\u2014t\u2014ry at the Navy Office, he found himself utterly unable to subsist any longer in town, and had actually offered his service, in quality of mate, to the surgeon of a merchant ship, bound to Guinea on the slaving trade; when, one morning, a young fellow, of whom he had some acquaintance, came to his lodgings, and informed him that he had seen a warrant made out in his name at the Navy Office, for surgeon\u2019s second mate of a third-rate. This unexpected piece of good news he could scarcely believe to be true, more especially as he had been found qualified at Surgeons\u2019 Hall for third mate only; but that he might not be wanting to himself, he went thither to be assured, and actually found it so: whereupon, demanding his warrant, it was delivered to him, and the oaths administered immediately. That very afternoon he went to Gravesend in the tilt-boat, from whence he took place in the tide-coach for Rochester; next morning got on board the \u201cThunder,\u201d for which he was appointed, then lying in the harbour at Chatham; and the same day was mustered by the clerk of the checque. And well it was for him that such expedition was used; for, in less than twelve hours after his arrival, another William Thompson came on board, affirming that he was the person for whom the warrant was expedited, and that the other was an impostor.\n\nMy friend was grievously alarmed at this accident, the more so, as his namesake had very much the advantage over him both in assurance and dress. However, to acquit himself of the suspicion of imposture, he produced several letters written from Scotland to him in that name, and, recollecting that his indentures were in a box on board, he brought them up, and convinced all present that he had not assumed a name which did not belong to him. His competitor, enraged that they should hesitate in doing him justice (for to be sure the warrant had been designed for him), behaved with so much indecent heat, that the commanding officer (who was the same gentleman I had seen) and the surgeon were offended at his presumption, and making a point of it with their friends in town, in less than a week got the first confirmed in his station. \u201cI have been on board,\u201d said he, \u201cever since; and, as this way of life is becoming familiar to me, have no cause to complain of my situation. The surgeon is a good-natured, indolent man; the first mate (who is now on shore on duty) is indeed a little proud and choleric, as all Welshmen are, but in the main a friendly honest fellow. The lieutenants I have no concern with; and, as for the captain, he is too much of a gentleman to know a surgeon\u2019s mate, even by sight.\u201d\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nThe behaviour of Mr. Morgan\u2014his pride, displeasure, and generosity\u2014the economy of our mess described\u2014Thomson\u2019s further friendship\u2014the nature of my duty explained\u2014the situation of the sick\n\nWhile he was thus discoursing to me, we heard a voice on the cockpit ladder pronounce with great vehemence, in a strange dialect, \u201cThe devil and his dam blow me from the top of Monchdenny, if I go to him before there is something in my pelly. Let his nose be as yellow as saffron, or as plue as a pell (look you), or as green as a leek, \u2019tis all one.\u201d To this declaration somebody answered, \u201cSo it seems my poor messmate must part his cable for want of a little assistance. His foretopsail is loose already; and besides the doctor ordered you to overhaul him; but I see you don\u2019t mind what your master says.\u201d Here he was interrupted with, \u201cSplutter and cons! you lousy tog, who do you call my master? Get you gone to the doctor, and tell him my birth, and education, and my abilities; and moreover, my behaviour is as good as his, or any shentleman\u2019s (no disparagement to him,) in the whole world. Cot pless my soul I does he think, or conceive, or imagine, that I am a horse, or an ass, or a goat, to trudge backwards and forwards, and upwards and downwards, and by sea and by land; at his will and pleasure? Go your ways, you rapscallion, and tell Doctor Atkins that I desire and request that he will give a look upon the tying man, and order something for him, if he be dead or alive, and I will see him take it by and by, when my craving stomach is satisfied, look you.\u201d At this, the other went away, saying, \u201cthat if they should serve him so when he was dying, by God he would be foul of them in the other world.\u201d Here Mr. Thompson let me know, that the person we heard was Mr. Morgan, the first mate, who was just come on board from the hospital, whither he had attended some of the sick in the morning; at the same time I saw him come into the berth. He was a short thick man, with a face garnished with pimples, a snub nose turned up at the end, an excessive wide mouth, and little fiery eyes, surrounded with skin puckered up in innumerable wrinkles. My friend immediately made him acquainted with my case; when he regarded me with a very lofty look, but without speaking, set down a bundle he had in his hand, and approached the cupboard, which, when he had opened, he exclaimed in a great passion, \u201cCot is my life, all the pork is gone, as I am a Christian!\u201d Thompson then gave him to understand, that, as I had been brought on board half famished, he could do no less than to entertain me with what was in the locker, and the rather as he had bid the steward enter me in the mess. Whether this disappointment made Mr. Morgan more peevish than usual, or he really thought himself too little regarded by his fellow mate, I know not, but after some pause, he went on in this manner: \u201cMr. Thompson, perhaps you do not use me with all the good manners, and complaisance, and respect (look you,) that becomes you, because you have not vouchsafed to advise with me in this affair. I have in my time (look you,) been a man of some weight, and substance, and consideration, and have kept house and home, and paid scot and lot, and the king\u2019s taxes; ay, and maintained a family to boot. And moreover, also, I am your senior, and your older, and your petter, Mr. Thompson.\u201d \u201cMy elder, I\u2019ll allow you to be, but not my better!\u201d cried Thompson, with some heat. \u201cCot is my Saviour, and witness too,\u201d said Morgan, with great vehemence, \u201cthat I am more elder, and therefore more petter by many years than you.\u201d Fearing this dispute might be attended with some bad consequence, I interposed, and told Mr. Morgan I was very sorry for having been the occasion of any difference between him and the second mate; and that, rather than cause the least breach in their good understanding, I would eat my allowance to myself, or seek admission into some other company. But Thompson, with more spirit than discretion (as I thought), insisted upon my remaining where he had appointed me; and observed that no man, possessed of generosity and compassion, would have any objection to it, considering my birth and talents, and the misfortunes I had of late so unjustly undergone.\n\nThis was touching Mr. Morgan on the right key, who protested with great earnestness, that he had no objection to my being received in the mess; but only complained that the ceremony of asking his consent was not observed. \u201cAs for a sheltenman in distress,\u201d said he, shaking me by the hand, \u201cI lofe him as I lofe my own powels: for, Cot help me! I have had vexations enough upon my own pack.\u201d And as I afterwards learned, in so saying, he spoke no more than what was true; for he had been once settled in a very good situation in Glamorganshire, and was ruined by being security for an acquaintance. All differences being composed, he untied his bundle, which consisted of three bunches of onions, and a great lump of Cheshire cheese, wrapped up in a handkerchief: and, taking some biscuit from the cupboard, fell to with a keen appetite, inviting us to share of the repast. When he had fed heartily on his homely fare, he filled a large cup, made of a cocoa-nut shell, with brandy, and, drinking it off, told us, \u201cPrandy was the best menstruum for onions and sheese.\u201d His hunger being appeased, he began to be in better humour; and, being inquisitive about my birth, no sooner understood that I was descended of a good family, than he discovered a particular good-will to me on that account, deducing his own pedigree in a direct line from the famous Caractacus, king of the Britons, who was first the prisoner, and afterwards the friend of Claudius Caesar. Perceiving how much I was reduced in point of linen, he made me a present of two good ruffled shirts, which, with two more of check which I received from Mr. Thompson, enabled me to appear with decency.\n\nMeanwhile the sailor, whom Mr. Morgan had sent to the doctor, brought a prescription for his messmate, which when the Welshman had read, he got up to prepare it, and asked, \u201cif the man was dead or alive.\u201d \u201cDead!\u201d replied Jack; \u201cif he was dead, he would have no occasion for doctor\u2019s stuff. No, thank God, death han\u2019t as yet boarded him. But they have been yard-arm and yard-arm these three glasses.\u201d \u201cAre his eyes open,\u201d continued the mate. \u201cHis starboard eye,\u201d said the sailor, \u201cis open, but fast jammed in his head: and the haulyards of his under jaw have given way.\u201d \u201cPassion of my heart!\u201d cried Morgan, \u201cthe man is as pad as one would desire to be! Did you feel his pulses!\u201d To this the other replied with \u201cAnan!\u201d Upon which this Cambro Briton, with great earnestness and humanity, ordered the tar to run to his messmate, and keep him alive till he should come with the medicine, \u201cand then,\u201d said he, \u201cyou shall peradventure pehold what you shall see.\u201d\n\nThe poor fellow, with great simplicity, ran to the place where the sick man lay, but in less than a minute returned with a woful countenance, and told us his comrade had struck. Morgan, hearing this, exclaimed, \u201cMercy upon my salvation! why did you not stop him till I came?\u201d \u201cStop him!\u201d said the other; \u201cI hailed him several times, but he was too far on his way, and the enemy had got possession of his close quarters; so that he did not mind me.\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d said he, \u201cwe all owe heaven a teath. Go your ways, you ragamuffin, and take an example and a warning, look you, and repent of your misteets.\u201d So saying, he pushed the seaman out of the berth.\n\nWhile we entertained us with reflections suitable to this event, we heard the boatswain pipe to dinner; and immediately the boy belonging to our mess ran to the locker, from whence he carried off a large wooden platter, and, in a few minutes, returned with it full of boiled peas, crying \u201cScaldings\u201d all the way as he came. The cloth, consisting of a piece of an old sail, was instantly laid, covered with three plates, which by the colour I could with difficulty discern to be metal, and as many spoons of the same composition, two of which were curtailed in the handles, and the other abridged in the lip. Mr. Morgan himself enriched this mess with a lump of salt butter scooped from an old gallipot, and a handful of onions shorn, with some pounded pepper. I was not very much tempted with the appearance of this dish, of which, nevertheless, my messmates ate heartily, advising me to follow their example, as it was banyan day and we could have no meat till next noon. But I had already laid in sufficient for the occasion, and therefore desired to be excused: expressing a curiosity to know the meaning of banyan day. They told me, that, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the ship\u2019s company had no allowance of meat, and that these meagre days were called banyan days, the reason of which they did not know; but I have since learned they take their denomination from a sect of devotees in some parts of the East Indies, who never taste flesh.\n\nAfter dinner Thompson led me round the ship, showed me the different parts, described their uses, and, as far as he could, made me acquainted with the particulars of the discipline and economy practised on board. He then demanded of the boatswain a hammock for me, which was slung in a very neat manner by my friend Jack Rattlin; and, as I had no bed-clothes, procured credit for me with the purser, for a mattress and two blankets. At seven o\u2019clock in the evening Morgan visited the sick, and, having ordered what was proper for each, I assisted Thompson in making up his prescriptions: but when I followed him with the medicines into the sick berth, or hospital, and observed the situation of the patients, I was much less surprised that people should die on board, than that a sick person should recover. Here I saw about fifty miserable distempered wretches, suspended in rows, so huddled one upon another, that not more than fourteen inches space was allotted for each with his bed and bedding; and deprived of the light of the day, as well as of fresh air; breathing nothing but a noisome atmosphere of the morbid steams exhaling from their own excrements and diseased bodies, devoured with vermin hatched in the filth that surrounded them, and destitute of every convenience necessary for people in that helpless condition.\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nA disagreeable accident happens to me in the discharge of my office\u2014Morgan\u2019s nose is offended\u2014a dialogue between him and the Ship\u2019s steward\u2014upon examination, I find more causes of complaint than one\u2014my hair is cut off\u2014Morgan\u2019s cookery\u2014the manner of sleeping on board\u2014I am waked in the night by a dreadful noise\n\nCould not comprehend how it was possible for the attendants to come near those who hung on the inside towards the sides of the ship, in order to assist them, as they seemed barricadoed by those who lay on the outside, and entirely out of the reach of all visitation; much less could I conceive how my friend Thompson would be able to administer clysters, that were ordered for some, in that situation; when I saw him thrust his wig in his pocket, and strip himself to his waistcoat in a moment, then creep on all fours under the hammocks of the sick, and, forcing up his bare pate between two, keep them asunder with one shoulder, until he had done his duty. Eager to learn the service, I desired he would give me leave to perform the next operation of that kind; and he consenting, I undressed myself after his example, and crawling along, the ship happened to roll: this motion alarming me, I laid hold of the first thing that came within my grasp with such violence, that I overturned it, and soon found, by the smell that issued upon me, that I had unlocked a box of the most delicious perfume. It was well for me that my nose was none of the most delicate, else I know not how I might have been affected by this vapour, which diffused itself all over the ship, to the utter discomposure of everybody who tarried on the same dock! neither was the consequence of this disgrace confined to my sense of smelling only; for I felt my misfortune more ways than one. That I might not, however, appear altogether disconcerted in this my first essay, I got up, and, pushing my head with great force between two hammocks, towards the middle, where the greatest resistance was, I made an opening indeed, but, not understanding the knack of dexterously turning my shoulder to maintain my advantage, had the mortification to find myself stuck up, as it were, in a pillory, and the weight of three or four people bearing on each side of my neck, so that I was in danger of strangulation. While I remained in this defenceless posture, one of the sick men, rendered peevish by his distemper, was so enraged at the smell I had occasioned and the rude shock he had received from me in my elevation, that, with many bitter reproaches, he seized me by the nose, which he tweaked so unmercifully, that I roared with anguish. Thompson, perceiving my condition, ordered one of the waiters to my assistance, who, with much difficulty, disengaged me from this situation, and hindered me from taking vengeance on the sick man, whose indisposition would not have screened him from the effects of my indignation.\n\nAfter having made an end of our ministry for that time, we descended to the cockpit, my friend comforting me for what had happened with a homely proverb, which I do not choose to repeat. When we had descended half-way down the ladder, Mr. Morgan, before he saw us, having intelligence by his nose of the approach of something extraordinary, cried, \u201cCot have mercy upon my senses! I pelieve the enemy has poarded us in a stinkpot!\u201d Then, directing his discourse to the steward, from whence he imagined the odour proceeded, he reprimanded him severely for the freedoms he took among gentlemen of birth, and threatened to smoke him like a padger with sulphur, if ever he should presume to offend his neighbours with such smells for the future. The steward, conscious of his own innocence, replied with some warmth, \u201cI know of no smells but those of your own making.\u201d This repartee introduced a smart dialogue, in which the Welshman undertook to prove, that, though the stench he complained of did not flow from the steward\u2019s own body, he was nevertheless the author of it, by serving out damaged provisions to the ship\u2019s company; and, in particular, putrified cheese, from the use of which only, he affirmed, such unsavoury steams could arise. Then he launched out into the praise of good cheese, of which he gave the analysis; explained the different kinds of that commodity, with the methods practised to make and preserve it, concluded in observing, that, in yielding good cheese, the county of Glamorgan might vie with Cheshire itself, and was much superior to it in the produce of goats and putter.\n\nI gathered from this conversation, that, if I entered in my present pickle, I should be no welcome guest, and therefore desired Mr. Thompson to go before, and represent my calamity; at which the first mate, expressing some concern, went upon deck immediately, taking his way through the cable-tier and the main hatchway, to avoid encountering me; desiring me to clean myself as soon as possible: for he intended to regale himself with a dish of salmagundy and a pipe. Accordingly, I set about this disagreeable business, and soon found I had more causes of complaint than I at first imagined; for I perceived some guests had honoured me with their company, whose visit I did not think seasonable: neither did they seem inclined to leave me in a hurry, for they were in possession of my chief quarters, where they fed without reserve at the expense of my blood. But, considering it would be easier to extirpate the ferocious colony in the infancy of their settlement, than after they should be multiplied and naturalised to the soil, I took the advice of my friend, who, to prevent such misfortunes, went always close shaved, and made the boy of our mess cut off my hair, which had been growing since I left the service of Lavement; and the second mate lent me an old bobwig to supply the loss of that covering. This affair being ended, and everything adjusted in the best manner my circumstances would permit, the descendant of Caractacus returned, and, ordering the boy to bring a piece of salt beef from the brine, cut off a slice, and mixed it with an equal quantity of onions, which seasoning with a moderate proportion of pepper and salt, he brought it to a consistence with oil and vinegar; then, tasting the dish, assured us it was the best salmagundy that ever he made, and recommended it to our palate with such heartiness that I could not help doing honour to his preparation. But I had no sooner swallowed a mouthful, than I thought my entrails were scorched, and endeavoured with a deluge of small-beer to allay the heat it occasioned. Supper being over, Mr. Morgan having smoked a couple of pipes, and supplied the moisture he had expended with as many cans of flip, of which we all partook, a certain yawning began to admonish me that it was high time to repair by sleep the injury I had suffered from want of rest the preceding night; which being perceived by my companions, whose time of repose was now arrived, they proposed we should turn in, or in other words, go to bed. Our hammocks, which hung parallel to one another, on the outside of the berth, were immediately unlashed, and I beheld my messmates spring with great agility into their respective nests, where they seemed to lie concealed, very much at their ease. But it was some time before I could prevail upon myself to trust my carcase at such a distance from the ground, in a narrow bag, out of which, I imagined, I should be apt, on the least motion in my sleep, to tumble down at the hazard of breaking my bones. I suffered myself, however, to be persuaded, and taking a leap to get in, threw myself quite over, with such violence, that had I not luckily got hold of Thompson\u2019s hammock, I should have pitched upon my head on the other side, and in all likelihood fractured my skull.\n\nAfter some fruitless efforts, I succeeded at last; but the apprehension of the jeopardy in which I believed myself withstood all the attacks of sleep till towards the morning watch, when, in spite of my fears, I was overpowered with slumber, though I did not long enjoy this comfortable situation, being aroused with a noise so loud and shrill, that I thought the drums of my ears were burst by it; this was followed by a dreadful summons pronounced by a hoarse voice, which I could not understand. While I was debating with myself, whether or not I should wake my companion and inquire into the occasion of this disturbance, I was informed by one of the quartermasters who passed by me with a lantern in his hand, that the noise which alarmed me was occasioned by the boatswain\u2019s mates who called up the larboard watch, and that I must lay my account with such an interruption every morning at the same hour. Being now more assured of my safety, I undressed myself again to rest, and slept till eight o\u2019clock, when rising, and breakfasting with my comrades on biscuit and brandy, the sick were visited and assisted as before; after which visitation my good friend Thompson explained and performed another piece of duty, to which I was a stranger. At a certain hour in the morning, the boy of the mess went round all the decks, ringing a small hand-bell, and, in rhymes composed for the occasion, invited all those who had sores to repair before the mast, where one of the doctor\u2019s mates attended, with applications to dress them.\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nI acquire the friendship of the Surgeon, who procures a warrant for me, and makes me a present of clothes\u2014a battle between a Midshipman and me\u2014the Surgeon leaves the ship\u2014the Captain comes on board with another Surgeon\u2014a dialogue between the Captain and Morgan\u2014the sick are ordered to be brought upon the Quarter-deck and examined\u2014the consequences of that order\u2014a Madman accuses Morgan, and is set at liberty by command of the Captain, whom he instantly attacks, and pummels without mercy\n\nWhile I was busied with my friend in the practice. The doctor chanced to pass by the place where we were, and stopping to observe me appeared very well satisfied with my application; and afterwards sent for me to his cabin, where, having examined me touching my skill in surgery, and the particulars of my fortune, he interested himself so far in my behalf, as to promise his assistance in procuring a warrant for me, seeing I had already been found qualified at Surgeons\u2019 Hall for the station I filled on board; and in this good office he the more cordially engaged when he understood I was nephew to lieutenant Bowling, for whom he expressed a particular regard. In the meantime, I could learn from his discourse that he did not intend to go to sea again with Captain Oakum, having, as he thought, been indifferently used by him during the last voyage.\n\nWhile I lived tolerably easy, in expectation of preferment, I was not altogether without mortifications, which I not only suffered from the rude insults of the sailors and petty officers, among whom I was known by the name of Loblolly Boy, but also from the disposition of Morgan, who, though friendly in the main, was often very troublesome with his pride, which expected a good deal of submission from me, and delighted in recapitulating the favours I had received at his hands.\n\nAbout six weeks after my arrival on board, the surgeon, bidding me to follow him into his cabin, presented a warrant to me, by which I was appointed surgeon\u2019s third mate on board the Thunder. This he had procured by his interest at the Navy Office; as also another for himself, by virtue of which he was removed into a second-rate. I acknowledged his kindness in the strongest terms my gratitude could suggest, and professed my sorrow at the prospect of losing so valuable a friend, to whom I hoped to have recommended myself still further, by my respectful and diligent behaviour. But his generosity rested not here; for before he left the ship he made me a present of a chest and some clothes that enabled me to support the rank to which he had raised me.\n\nI found my spirit revive with my good fortune; and, now I was an officer, resolved to maintain the dignity of my station, against all opposition or affronts; nor was it long before I had occasion to exert my resolution. My old enemy, the midshipman (whose name was Crampley), entertaining an implacable animosity against me for the disgrace he had suffered on my account, had since that time taken all opportunities of reviling and ridiculing me, when I was not entitled to retort this bad usage; and, even after I had been rated on the books, and mustered as surgeon\u2019s mate, did not think fit to restrain his insolence. In particular, being one day present while I dressed a wound in a sailor\u2019s leg, he began to sing a song, which I thought highly injurious to the honour of my country, and therefore signified my resentment, by observing that the Scots always laid their account with finding enemies among the ignorant, insignificant, and malicious. This unexpected piece of assurance enraged him to such a degree, that he lent me a blow on the face, which I verily thought had demolished my cheek-bone. I was not slow in returning the obligation, and the affair began to be very serious, when by accident Mr. Morgan, and one of the master\u2019s mates, coming that way, interposed, and, inquiring into the cause, endeavoured to promote a reconciliation; but, finding us both exasperated to the uttermost, and bent against accommodation, they advised us either to leave our difference undecided, till we should have an opportunity of terminating it on shore, like gentlemen, or else choose a proper place on board, and bring it to an issue by boxing. The last expedient was greedily embraced by us both; and, being forthwith conducted to the ground proposed, we stripped in a moment, and began a furious contest, in which I soon found myself inferior to my antagonist, not so much in strength and agility, as in skill, which he had acquired in the school of Hockley-in-the-Hole at Tottenham-court. Many cross buttocks did I sustain, and pegs on the stomach without number, till at last my breath being quite gone, as well as my vigour wasted, I grew desperate, and collecting all my strength in one effort, threw in at once, head, hands, and feet, with such violence, that I drove my antagonist three paces backward into the main hatchway, down which he fell, and pitching upon his head and right shoulder, remained without sense and motion. Morgan, looking down, and seeing him lie in that condition, cried, \u201cUpon my conscience, as I am a Christian sinner, (look you,) I believe his pattles are all ofer; but I take you all to witness that there was no treachery in the case, and that he has suffered by the chance of war.\u201d So saying he descended to the deck below, to examine into the situation of my adversary, and left me very little pleased with my victory, as I found myself not only terribly bruised, but likewise in danger of being called to account for the death of Crampley; but this fear vanished when my fellow-mate having, by bleeding him in the jugular, brought him to himself, and inquired into the state of his body, called up to me to be under no concern, for the midshipman had received no other damage than as pretty a luxation of the os humeri as one would desire to see on a summer\u2019s day. Upon this information I crawled down to the cock-pit, and acquainted Thompson with the affair, who, providing himself with bandages, etc, necessary for the occasion, went up to assist Mr. Morgan in the reduction of the dislocation. When this was successfully performed, they wished me joy of the event of the combat; and the Welshman, after observing, that, in all likelihood, the ancient Scots and Britons were the same people, bade me \u201cpraise Cot for putting mettle in my pelly, and strength in my limbs to support it.\u201d I acquired such reputation by this rencontre, which lasted twenty minutes, that everybody became more cautious in behaviour towards me; though Crampley, with his arm in a sling, talked very high, and threatened to seize the first opportunity of retrieving on shore the honour he had lost by an accident, from which I could justly claim no merit.\n\nAbout this time, Captain Oakum, having received sailing orders, came on board, and brought along with him a surgeon of his own country, who soon made us sensible of the loss we suffered in the departure of Doctor Atkins; for he was grossly ignorant, and intolerably assuming, false, vindictive, and unforgiving; a merciless tyrant to his inferiors, an abject sycophant to those above him. In the morning after the captain came on board, our first mate, according to custom, went to wait on him with a sick list, which, when this grim commander had perused, he cried with a stern countenance, \u201cBlood and cons! sixty-one sick people on board of my ship! Harkee, you sir, I\u2019ll have no sick in my ship, by G\u2014d.\u201d The Welshman replied, \u201che should be very glad to find no sick people on board: but, while it was otherwise, he did no more than his duty in presenting him with a list.\u201d \u201cYou and your list may be d\u2014n\u2019d,\u201d said the captain, throwing it at him; \u201cI say, there shall be no sick in this ship while I have the command of her.\u201d Mr. Morgan, being nettled at this treatment, told him his indignation ought to be directed to Cot Almighty, who visited his people with distempers, and not to him, who contributed all in his power towards their cure. The bashaw, not being used to such behaviour in any of his officers, was enraged to fury at this satirical insinuation, and, stamping with his foot, called him insolent scoundrel, threatening to have him pinioned to the deck, if he should presume to utter another syllable. But the blood of Caractacus being thoroughly heated, disdained to be restricted by such a command, and began to manifest itself in, \u201cCaptain Oakum, I am a shentleman of birth and parentage (look you), and peradventure I am moreover.\u201d Here his harangue was broken off by the captain\u2019s steward, who, being Morgan\u2019s countryman, hurried him out of the cabin before he had time to exasperate his master to a greater degree, and this would certainly have been the case; for the indignant Welshman could hardly be hindered by his friend\u2019s arguments and entreaties from re-entering the presence-chamber, and defying Captain Oakum to his teeth. He was, however appeased at length, and came down to the berth, where, finding Thompson and me at work preparing medicines, he bade us leave off our lapour to go to play, for the captain, by his sole word, and power, and command, had driven sickness a pegging to the tevil, and there was no more malady on board. So saying, he drank off a gill of brandy sighed grievously three times, poured fort an ejaculation of \u201cCot pless my heart, liver, and lungs!\u201d and then began to sing a Welsh song with great earnestness of visage, voice, and gesture. I could not conceive the meaning of this singular phenomenon, and saw by the looks of Thompson, who at the same time shook his head, that he suspected poor Cadwallader\u2019s brains were unsettled. He, perceiving our amazement, told us he would explain the mystery; but at the same time bade us take notice, that he had lived poy, patchelor, married man, and widower, almost forty years, and in all that time there was no man, nor mother\u2019s son in the whole world who durst use him so ill as Captain Oakum had done. Then he acquainted us with the dialogue that passed between them, as I have already related it: and had no sooner finished this narration than he received a message from the surgeon, to bring the sick-list to the quarter-deck, for the captain had ordered all the patients thither to be reviewed.\n\nThis inhuman order shocked us extremely, as we knew it would be impossible to carry some of them on the deck, without imminent danger of their lives: but, as we likewise knew it would be to no purpose for us to remonstrate against it, we repaired to the quarter-deck in a body, to see this extraordinary muster; Morgan observing by the way, that the captain was going to send to the other world a great many evidences to testify against himself. When we appeared upon deck, the captain bade the doctor, who stood bowing at his right hand, look at these lazy lubberly sons of bitches, who were good for nothing on board but to eat the king\u2019s provision, and encourage idleness in the skulkers. The surgeon grinned approbation, and, taking the list, began to examine the complaints of each as they could crawl to the place appointed. The first who came under his cognizance was a poor fellow just freed of a fever, which had weakened him so much that he could hardly stand. Mr. Mackshane (for that was the doctor\u2019s name), having felt his pulse, protested he was as well as any man in the world; and the captain delivered him over to the boatswain\u2019s mate, with orders that he should receive a round dozen at the gangway immediately, for counterfeiting himself sick; but, before the discipline could be executed, the man dropped down on the deck, and had well nigh perished under the hands of the executioner. The next patient to be considered, laboured under a quartan ague, and, being then in his interval of health, discovered no other symptoms of distemper than a pale meagre countenance and emaciated body; upon which he was declared fit for duty, and turned over to the boatswain; but, being resolved to disgrace the doctor, died upon the forecastle next day, during his cold fit. The third complained of a pleuritic stitch, and spitting of blood, for which Doctor Mackshane prescribed exercise at the pump to promote expectoration! but whether this was improper for one in his situation, or that it was used to excess, I know not, but in less than half-an-hour he was suffocated with a deluge of blood that issued from his lungs. A fourth, with much difficulty, climbed to the quarter-deck, being loaded with a monstrous ascites, or dropsy, that invaded his chest so much, he could scarce fetch his breath; but his disease being interpreted into fat, occasioned by idleness and excess of eating, he was ordered, with a view to promote perspiration and enlarge his chest, to go aloft immediately. It was in vain for this unwieldy wretch to allege his utter incapacity; the boatswain\u2019s driver was commanded to whip him up with the cat-and-nine-tails; the smart of this application made him exert himself so much, that he actually arrived at the puttock shrouds; but when the enormous weight of his body had nothing else to support than his weakened arms, either out of spite or necessity, he quitted his hold, and plunged into the sea, where he must have been drowned, had not a sailor, who was in a boat alongside, saved his life, by keeping him afloat till he was hoisted on board by a tackle.\n\nIt would be tedious and disagreeable to describe the fate of every miserable object that suffered by the inhumanity and ignorance of the captain and surgeon, who so wantonly sacrificed the lives of their fellow-creatures. Many were brought up in the height of fevers, and rendered delirious by the injuries they received in the way. Some gave up the ghost in the presence of their inspectors; and others, who were ordered to their duties, languished a few days at work among their fellows, and then departed without any ceremony. On the whole, the number of the sick was reduced to less than a dozen; and the authors of this reduction were applauding themselves for the services they had done to their king and country, when the boatswain\u2019s mate informed his honour, that there was a man below lashed to his hammock, by direction of the doctor\u2019s mate, and that he begged hard to be released; affirming, he had been so maltreated only for a grudge Mr. Morgan bore him, and that he was as much in his senses as any man aboard. The captain hearing this, darted a severe look at the Welshman, and ordered the man to be brought up immediately; upon which, Morgan protested with great fervency, that the person in question was as mad as a March hare; and begged for the love of Cot, they would at least keep his arms pinioned during his examination, to prevent him from doing mischief. This request the commander granted for his own sake, and the patient was produced, who insisted upon his being in his right wits with such calmness and strength of argument, that everybody present was inclined to believe him, except Morgan, who affirmed there was no trusting to appearances; for he himself had been so much imposed upon by his behaviour two days before, that he had actually unbound him with his own hands, and had well nigh been murdered for his pains: this was confirmed by the evidence of one of the waiters, who declared he had pulled this patient from the doctor\u2019s mate, whom he had gotten down, and almost strangled. To this the man answered, that the witness was a creature of Morgan\u2019s, and suborned to give his testimony against him by the malice of the mate, whom the defendant had affronted, by discovering to the people on board, that Mr. Morgan\u2019s wife kept a gin-shop in Ragfair. This anecdote produced a laugh at the expense of the Welshman, who, shaking his head with some emotion, said, \u201cAy, ay, \u2019tis no matter. Cot knows, it is an arrant falsehood.\u201d Captain Oakum, without any farther hesitation, ordered the fellow to be unfettered; at the same time, threatening to make Morgan exchange situations with him for his spite; but the Briton no sooner heard the decision in favour of the madman, than he got up to the mizen-shrouds, crying to Thompson and me to get out of his reach, for we should see him play the devil with a vengeance. We did not think fit to disregard his caution, and accordingly got up on the poop, whence we beheld the maniac (as soon as he was released) fly at the captain like a fury, crying, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know, you scoundrel, that I am commander of this vessel,\u201d and pummel him without mercy. The surgeon, who went to the assistance of his patron, shared the same fate; and it was with the utmost difficulty that he was mastered at last, after having done great execution among those who opposed him.\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nThe Captain enraged, threatens to put the Madman to death with his own hand\u2014is diverted from that resolution by the arguments and persuasion of the first Lieutenant and Surgeon\u2014we set sail for St. Helen\u2019s, join the fleet under the command of Sir C\u2014 O\u2014gle, and proceed for the West Indies\u2014are overtaken by a terrible tempest\u2014my friend Jack Rattlin has his leg broke by a fall from the mainyard\u2014the behaviour of Mr. Mackshane\u2014Jack opposes the amputation of his limb, in which he is seconded by Morgan and me, we undertake the cure and perform it successfully\n\nThe captain was carried into his cabin, so enraged with the treatment he had received, that he ordered the fellow to be brought before him, that he might have the pleasure of pistoling him with his own hand; and would certainly have satisfied his revenge in this manner, had not the first lieutenant remonstrated against it, by observing that, in all appearances, the fellow was not mad, but desperate; that he had been hired by some enemy of the captain\u2019s to him, and therefore ought to be kept in irons till he could be brought to a court-martial, which, no doubt, would sift the affair to the bottom (by which means important discoveries might be made), and then sentence the criminal to a death according to his demerits. This suggestion, improbable as it was, had the desired effect upon the captain, being exactly calculated for the meridan of his intellects; more especially as Dr. Mackshane espoused this opinion, in consequence of his previous declaration that the man was not mad. Morgan finding there was no more damage done, could not help discovering by his countenance the pleasure he enjoyed on this occasion; and, while he bathed the doctor\u2019s face with an embrocation, ventured to ask him, whether he thought there were more fools or madmen on board? But he would have been wiser in containing this sally, which his patient carefully laid up in his memory, to be taken notice of at a more fit season. Meanwhile we weighed anchor, and, on our way to the Downs, the madman, who was treated as a prisoner, took an opportunity, while the sentinel attending him was at the head, to leap and frustrate the revenge of the captain. We stayed not long at the Downs, but took the benefit of the first easterly wind to go round to Spithead: where, having received provisions on board for six months, we sailed from St. Helen\u2019s in the grand fleet bound for the West Indies, on the ever-memorable expedition of Carthagena.\n\nIt was not without great mortification I saw myself on the point of being transported to such a distant and unhealthy climate, destitute of every convenience that could render such a voyage supportable, and under the dominion of an arbitrary tyrant, whose command was almost intolerable; however, as these complaints were common to a great many on board, I resolved to submit patiently to my fate, and contrive to make myself as easy as the nature of the case would allow. We got out of the channel with a prosperous breeze, which died away, leaving us becalmed about fifty leagues to the westward of the Lizard: but this state of inaction did not last long; for next night our maintop-sail was split by the wind, which, in the morning, increased to a hurricane. I was awakened by a most horrible din, occasioned by the play of the gun carriages upon the decks above, the cracking of cabins, the howling of the wind through the shrouds, the confused noise of the ship\u2019s crew, the pipes of the boatswain and his mates, the trumpets of the lieutenants, and the clanking of the chain pumps. Morgan who had never been at sea before, turned out in a great hurry, crying, \u201cCot have mercy and compassion upon us! I believe, we have cot upon the confines of Lucifer and the d\u2014n\u2019d!\u201d while poor Thompson lay quaking in his hammock, putting up petitions to heaven for our safety. I rose and joined the Welshman, with whom (after having fortified ourselves with brandy) I went above; but if my sense of hearing was startled before, how must my sight have been apalled in beholding the effects of the storm! The sea was swelled into billows mountain-high, on the top of which our ship sometimes hung as if it were about to be precipitated to the abyss below! Sometimes we sank between two waves that rose on each side higher than our topmast-head, and threatened by dashing together to overwhelm us in a moment! Of all our fleet, consisting of a hundred and fifty sail, scarce twelve appeared, and these driving under their bare poles, at the mercy of the tempest. At length the mast of one of them gave way, and tumbled overboard with a hideous crash! Nor was the prospect in our own ship much more agreeable; a number of officers and sailors ran backward and forward with distraction in their looks, halloaing to one another, and undetermined what they should attend to first. Some clung to the yards, endeavouring to unbend the sails that were split into a thousand pieces flapping in the wind; others tried to furl those which were yet whole, while the masts, at every pitch, bent and quivered like twigs, as if they would have shivered into innumerable splinters! While I considered this scene with equal terror and astonishment, one of the main braces broke, by the shock whereof two sailors were flung from the yard\u2019s arm into the sea, where they perished, and poor Jack Rattlin thrown down upon the deck, at the expense of a broken leg. Morgan and I ran immediately to his assistance, and found a splinter of the shin-bone thrust by the violence of the fall through the skin; as this was a case of too great consequence to be treated without the authority of the doctor I went down to his cabin to inform him of the accident, as well as to bring up dressings which we always kept ready prepared. I entered his apartment without any ceremony, and, by the glimmering of a lamp, perceived him on his knees before something that very much resembled a crucifix; but this I will not insist upon, that I may not seem too much a slave to common report, which indeed assisted my conjecture on this occasion, by representing Dr. Mackshane as a member of the church of Rome. Be this as it will, he got up in a sort of confusion, occasioned (I suppose) by his being disturbed in his devotion, and in a trice snatched the subject of my suspicion from my sight.\n\nAfter making an apology for my intrusion, I acquainted him with the situation of Rattlin, but could by no means prevail upon him to visit him on deck, where he lay; he bade me desire the boatswain to order some of the men to carry him down to the cockpit, \u201cand in the meantime,\u201d said he, \u201cI will direct Thompson to get ready the dressings.\u201d When I signified to the boatswain the doctor\u2019s desire, he swore a terrible oath, that he could not spare one man from deck, because he expected the mast would go by the board every minute. This piece of information did not at all contribute to my peace of mind; however, as my friend Rattlin complained very much, with the assistance of Morgan I supported him to the lower deck, whither Mr. Mackshane, after much entreaty, ventured to come, attended by Thompson, with a box full of dressings, and his own servant, who carried a whole set of capital instruments. He examined the fracture and the wound, and concluding, from a livid colour extending itself upon the limb, that mortification would ensue, resolved to amputate the leg immediately. This was a dreadful sentence to the patient, who, recruiting himself with a quid of tobacco, pronounced with a woful countenance, \u201cWhat! is there no remedy, doctor! must I be dock\u2019d? can\u2019t you splice it?\u201d \u201cAssuredly, Doctor Mackshane,\u201d said the first mate, \u201cwith submission, and deference, and veneration, to your superior apilities, and opportunities, and stations, look you, I do apprehend, and conjure, and aver, that there is no occasion nor necessity to smite off this poor man\u2019s leg.\u201d \u201cGod Almighty bless you, dear Welshman!\u201d cried Rattlin, \u201cmay you have fair wind and weather wheresoever you\u2019re bound, and come to an anchor in the road of heaven at last!\u201d Mackshane, very much incensed at his mate\u2019s differing in opinion from him, so openly, answered, that he was not bound to give an account of his practice to him; and in a peremptory tone, ordered him to apply the tourniquet. At the sight of which, Jack, starting up, cried, \u201cAvast, avast! D\u2014n my heart, if you clap your nippers on me, till I know wherefore! Mr. Random, won\u2019t you lend a hand towards saving my precious limb! Odd\u2019s heart, if Lieutenant Bowling was here, he would not suffer Jack Rattlin\u2019s leg to be chopped off like a piece of old junk.\u201d\n\nThis pathetic address to me, joined to my inclination to serve my honest friend, and the reasons I had to believe there was no danger in delaying the amputation, induced me to declare myself of the first mate\u2019s opinion, and affirm that the preternatural colour of the skin was owing to an inflammation, occasioned by a contusion, and common in all such cases, without any indication of an approaching gangrene. Morgan, who had a great opinion of my skill, manifestly exulted in my fellowship, and asked Thompson\u2019s sentiments in the matter, in hopes of strengthening our association with him too; but he, being of a meek disposition, and either dreading the enmity of the surgeon, or speaking the dictates of his own judgment, in a modest manner espoused the opinion of Mackshane, who by this time having consulted with himself, determined to act in such a manner as to screen himself from censure, and at the same time revenge himself on us, for our arrogance in contradicting him. With this view, he asked if we would undertake to cure the leg at our peril: that is, be answerable for the consequence. To this question, Morgan replied, that the lives of his creatures are at the hands of Cot alone; and it would be great presumption in him to undertake for an event that was in the power of his Maker, no more than the doctor could promise to cure all the sick to whom he administered his assistance; but if the patient would put himself under our direction, we would do our endeavour to bring his distemper to a favourable issue, to which at present we saw no obstruction.\n\nI signified my concurrence; and Rattlin was so overjoyed that, shaking us both by the hands, he swore nobody else should touch him, and, if he died, his blood should be upon his own head. Mr. Mackshane, flattering himself with the prospect of our miscarriage, went away, and left us to manage it as we should think proper; accordingly, having sawed off part of the splinter that stuck through the skin, we reduced the fracture, dressed the wound, applied the eighteen-tailed bandage, and put the leg in a box, secundam artem. Everything succeeded according to our wish, and we had the satisfaction of not only preserving the poor fellow\u2019s leg, but likewise of rendering the doctor contemptible among the ship\u2019s company, who had all their eyes on us during the course of this cure, which was completed in six weeks.\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nMackshane\u2019s malice\u2014I am taken up and imprisoned for a spy\u2014Morgan meets with the same fate\u2014Thompson is tampered with to turn evidence against us\u2014disdains the proposal, and is maltreated for his integrity\u2014Morgan is released to assist the Surgeon during an engagement with some French ships-of-war\u2014I remain fettered on the poop, exposed to the enemy\u2019s shot, and grow delirious with fear\u2014am comforted after the battle by Morgan, who speaks freely of the captain, is overheard by the sentinel, who informs against him, and again imprisoned\u2014Thompson grows desperate, and, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Morgan and me, goes overboard in the night\n\nIn the meantime the storm subsided into a brisk gale, that carried us into the warm latitudes, where the weather became intolerable, and the crew very sickly. The doctor left nothing unattempted towards the completion of his vengeance against the Welshman and me. He went among the sick under pretence of inquiring into their grievances, with a view of picking up complaints to our prejudice; but, finding himself frustrated in that expectation by the goodwill we had procured from the patients by our diligence and humanity, he took the resolution of listening to our conversation, by hiding himself behind the canvas that surrounded our berth; here too he was detected by the boy of our mess, who acquainted us with this piece of behaviour, and one night, while we were picking a large bone of salt beef, Morgan discerned something stir on the outside of our hangings, which immediately interpreting to be the doctor, he tipped me the wink, and pointed to the place, where I could perceive somebody standing; upon which, I snatched up the bone, and levelled it with all my force at him, saying, \u201cWhoever you are, take that for your curiosity.\u201d It had the desired effect, for we heard the listener tumble down, and afterwards crawl to his own cabin. I applauded myself much for this feat, which turned out one of the most unlucky exploits of my life, Mackshane, from that time, marking me out for destruction.\n\nAbout a week after this exploit, as I was going my rounds among the sick, I was taken prisoner, and carried to the poop by the master-at-arms, where I was loaded with irons, and stapled to the deck, on pretence that I was a spy on board, and had conspired against the captain\u2019s life. How ridiculous soever this imputation was, I did not fail to suffer by it all the rigour that could be shown to the worst of criminals, being exposed in this miserable condition to the scorching heat of the sun by day, and the unwholesome damps by night, during the space of twelve days, in which I was neither brought to trial, nor examined touching the probability of the charge. I had no sooner recovered the use of my reflection, which had been quite overthrown by this accident, than I sent for Thompson, who, after condoling me on the occasion, hinted, that I owed this misfortune to the hatred of the doctor, who had given an information against me to the captain, in consequence of which I was arrested, and all my papers seized. While I was cursing my capricious fate, I saw Morgan ascend the poop, guarded by two corporals, who made him sit down by me, that he might be pinioned in the same machine. Notwithstanding my situation, I could scarce refrain from laughing at the countenance of my fellow prisoner, who, without speaking one word, allowed his feet to be inclosed in the rings provided for that purpose; but, when they pretended to fasten him on his back he grew outrageous, and drawing a large couteau from his side-pocket, threatened to rip up the belly of the first man that should approach him, in order to treat him in such an unworthy manner. They were prepared to use him very roughly, when the lieutenant on the quarter-deck called up to them to let him remain as he was. He then crept towards me, and, taking me by the hand, bade me \u201cput my trust in Cot.\u201d And looking at Thompson, who sat by us trembling, with a pale visage; told him there were two more rings for his feet, and he should be glad to find him in such good company. But it was not the intention of our adversary to include the second mate in our fate: him he expected to be his drudge in attending the sick and, if possible, his evidence against us: with this view he sounded him afar off, but, finding his integrity incorruptible, harrassed him so much out of spite, that in a short time this mild creature grew weary of his life.\n\nWhile I and my fellow prisoner comforted each other in our tribulation, the admiral discovered four sail to leeward and made signal for our ship and four more to chase: hereupon everything was cleared for an engagement, and Mackshane, foreseeing he should have occasion for more assistants than one obtained Morgan\u2019s liberty, while I was let in this deplorable posture to the chance of battle. It was almost dark when we came up with the sternmost chase, which we hailed, and inquired who they were. They gave us to understand they were French men-of-war, upon which Captain Oakum commanded them to send their boat on board of him! but they refused, telling him, if he had any business with them, to come on board of their ship: he then threatened to pour in a broadside upon them, which they promised to retain. Both sides were as good as their word, and the engagement began with great fury. The reader may guess how I passed my time, lying in this helpless situation, amidst the terrors of a sea-fight; expecting every moment to be cut asunder, or dashed in pieces by the enemy\u2019s shot! I endeavoured to compose myself as much as possible, by reflecting that I was not a whit more exposed than those who were stationed about me; but, when I beheld them employed without intermission in annoying the foe, and encouraged by the society and behaviour of one another, I could easily perceive a wide difference between their condition and mine: however, I concealed my agitation as well as I could till the head of the officer of marines who stood near me, being shot off, bounced from the deck athwart my face, leaving me well nigh blinded with brains. I could contain myself no longer, but began to bellow with all the strength of my lungs; when a drummer, coming towards me asked if I was wounded, and, before I could answer, received a great shot in his belly, which tore out his entrails, and he fell flat on my breast. This accident entirely bereft me of all discretion; I redoubled my cries, which were drowned in the noise of the battle; and, finding myself disregarded, lost all patience, and became frantic. I vented my rage in oaths and execrations, till my spirits, being quite exhausted, I remained quiet, as insensible of the load that oppressed me.\n\nThe engagement lasted till broad day, when Captain Oakum, finding he was like to gain neither honour nor advantage by the affair, pretended to be undeceived by seeing their colours; and, hailing the ship whom he had fought all night, protested he believed them Spaniards; and the guns being silenced on each side, ordered the barge to be hoisted out, and went on board the French commodore. Our loss amounted to ten killed, and eighteen wounded, most part of whom afterwards died. My fellow-mates had no sooner despatched their business in the cock-pit, than, full of friendly concern, they came to visit me. Morgan, ascending first, and seeing my face almost covered with brains and blood, concluded I was no longer a man for this world; and, calling to Thompson with great emotion, bade him come up, and take his last farewell of his comrade and countryman, who was posted to a better place, where there were no Mackshanes nor Oakums to asperse and torment him. \u201cNo,\u201d said he, taking me by the hand, \u201cyou are going to a country where there is more respect sown to unfortunate shentlemen, and where you will have the satisfaction of peholding your adversaries tossing upon pillows of purning primstone.\u201d Thompson, alarmed at this apostrophe, made haste to the place where I lay, and sitting down by me, with tears in his eyes inquired into the nature of my calamity. By this time I had recollected myself so far as to be able to converse rationally with my friends, whom, to their great satisfaction, I immediately undeceived with regard to their apprehension of my being mortally wounded.\n\nAfter I had got myself disengaged from the carnage in which I wallowed, and partaken of a refreshment which my friends brought along with them, we entered into discourse upon the hardships we sustained, and spoke very freely of the author of our misery; but our discourse being overheard by the sentinel who guarded me, he was no sooner relieved than he reported to the captain every syllable of our conversation, according to the orders he had received. The effect of this information soon appeared in the arrival of the master-at-arms, who replaced Morgan in his former station, and gave the second mate a caution to keep a strict guard over his tongue, if he did not choose to accompany us in our confinement. Thompson, foreseeing that the whole slavery of attending the sick and wounded, as well as the cruelty of Mackshane, must now fall upon his shoulders, grew desperate at the prospect, and, though I never heard him swear before, imprecated dreadful curses on the heads of his oppressors, declaring that he would rather quit life altogether than be much longer under the power of such barbarians. I was not a little startled at his vivacity, and endeavoured to alleviate his complaints, by representing the subject of my own, with as much aggravation as it would bear, by which comparison he might see the balance of misfortune lay on my side, and take an example from me of fortitude and submission, till such time as we could procure redress, which I hoped was not far off, considering that we should probably be in a harbour in less than three days, where we should have an opportunity of preferring our complaints to the admiral. The Welshman joined in my remonstrance, and was at great pains to demonstrate that it was every man\u2019s duty as well as interest to resign himself to the divine will, and look upon himself as a sentinel upon duty, who is by no means at liberty to leave his post before he is relieved. Thompson listened attentively to what he said, and at last, shedding a flood of tears, shook his hand, and left us without making any reply. About eleven at night he came to see us again with a settled gloom on his countenance, and gave us to understand that he had undergone excessive toil since he saw us, and in recompense had been grossly abused by the doctor, who taxed him with being confederate with us, in a design of taking away his life and that of the captain. After some time spent in mutual exhortation, he got up, and squeezing me by the hand with uncommon fervour, cried, \u201cGod bless you both!\u201d and left us to wonder at his singular manner of parting with us, which did not fail to make a deep impression on us both.\n\nNext morning, when the hour of visitation came round, the unhappy young man was missing, and, after strict search, supposed to have gone overboard in the night; and this was certainly the case.\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nWe lament the fate of our companion\u2014the Captain offers Morgan his liberty, which he refuses to accept\u2014we are brought before him and examined\u2014Morgan is sent back into custody, whither also I am remanded after a curious trial\n\nThe news of this event affected my fellow prisoner and me extremely, as our unfortunate companion had justly acquired by his amiable disposition the love and esteem of us both; and the more we regretted his untimely fate, the greater horror we conceived for the villain who was undoubtedly the occasion of it. This abandoned miscreant did not discover the least symptom of concern for Thompson\u2019s death, although he must have been conscious to himself of having driven him by ill usage to the fatal resolution, but desired the captain to set Morgan at liberty again to look after the patients. Accordingly one of the corporals was sent up to unfetter him, but he protested he would not be released until he should know for what he was confined; nor would he be a tennisball, nor a shuttlecock, nor a trudge, nor a scullion, to any captain under the sun. Oakum, finding him obstinate, and fearing it would not be in his power to exercise his tyranny much longer with impunity, was willing to show some appearance of justice and therefore ordered us both to be brought before him on the quarter-deck, where he sat in state, with his cleric on one side, and his counsellor Mackshane on the other. When we approached, he honoured us with this salutation: \u201cSo, gentlemen, d\u2014n my blood! many a captain in the navy would have ordered you both to be tucked up to the yard\u2019s arm, without either judge or jury, for the crimes you have been guilty of; but, d\u2014n my blood, I have too much good nature in allowing such dogs as you to make defence.\u201d \u201cCaptain Oakum,\u201d said my fellow-sufferer, \u201ccertainly it is in your power (Cot help the while) to tack us all up at your will, desire, and pleasures. And perhaps it would be petter for some of us to be tucked up than to undergo the miseries to which we have been exposed. So may the farmer hang his kids for his diversion, and amusement, and mirth; but there is such a thing as justice, if not upon earth, surely in heaven, that will punish with fire and primstone all those who take away the lives of innocent people out of wantonness, and parparity (look you). In the mean time. I shall be glad to know the crimes laid to my charge, and see the person who accuses me.\u201d \u201cThat you shall,\u201d said the captain; \u201chere, doctor, what have you to say?\u201d Mackshane, stepping forward, hemmed a good while, in order to clear his throat, and, before he began, Morgan accosted him thus: \u201cDoctor Mackshane, look in my face\u2014look in the face of an honest man, who abhors a false witness as he abhors the tevil, and Cot be judge between you and me.\u201d The doctor, not minding this conjuration, made the following speech, as near as I can remember: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, Mr. Morgan; to be sure what you say is just, in regard to an honest man, and if so be it appears as how you are an honest man, then it is my opinion that you deserve to be acquitted, in relation to that there affair, for I tell you what, Captain Oakum is resolved for to do everybody justice. As for my own part, all that I have to allege is, that I have been informed you have spoken disrespectful words against your captain, who, to be sure, is the most honourable and generous commander in the king\u2019s service, without asparagement or acception of man, woman, or child.\u201d\n\nHaving uttered this elegant harangue, on which he seemed to plume himself, Morgan replied, \u201cI do partly guess, and conceive, and understand your meaning, which I wish could be more explicit; but, however, I do suppose, I am not to be condemned upon bare hearsay; or, if I am convicted of speaking disrespectfully of Captain Oakum, I hope there is no treason in my words.\u201d \u201cBut there\u2019s mutiny, by G\u2014d, and that\u2019s death by the articles of war!\u201d cried Oakum: \u201cIn the meantime, let the witnesses be called.\u201d Hereupon Mackshane\u2019s servant appeared, and the boy of our mess, whom they had seduced and tutored for the purpose. The first declared, that Morgan as he descended the cockpit-ladder one day, cursed the captain, and called him a savage beast, saying, he ought to be hunted down as an enemy to mankind. \u201cThis,\u201d said the clerk, \u201cis a strong presumption of a design, formed against the captain\u2019s life. For why? It presupposes malice aforethought, and a criminal intention a priori.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d said the captain to this miserable grub, who had been an attorney\u2019s boy, \u201cyou shall have law enough: here\u2019s Cook and Littlejohn to it.\u201d This evidence was confirmed by the boy, who affirmed, he heard the first mate say, that the captain had no more bowels than a bear, and the surgeon had no more brain than an ass. Then the sentinel, who heard our discourse on the poop was examined, and informed the court that the Welshman assured me, Captain Oakum and Doctor Mackshane would toss upon billows of burning brimstone in hell for their barbarity. The clerk observed, that there was an evident prejudication, which confirmed the former suspicion of a conspiracy against the life of Captain Oakum; for, because, how could Morgan so positively pronounce that the captain and surgeon would d\u2014n\u2019d, unless he had intention to make away with them before they could have time to repent? This sage explanation had great weight with our noble commander, who exclaimed, \u201cWhat have you to say to this, Taffy? you seem to be taken all a-back, brother, ha!\u201d Morgan was too much of a gentleman to disown the text, although he absolutely denied the truth of the comment. Upon which the captain, strutting up to him with a ferocious countenance, said, \u201cSo Mr. son of a bitch, you confess you honoured me with the names of bear and beast, and pronounced my damnation? D\u2014n my heart! I have a good mind to have you brought to a court-martial and hang\u2019d, you dog.\u201d Here Mackshane, having occasion for an assistant, interposed, and begged the captain to pardon Mr. Morgan with his wonted goodness, upon condition that he the delinquent should make such submission as the nature of his misdemeanour demanded. Upon which the Cambro-Briton, who on this occasion would have made no submission to the Great Mogul, surrounded with his guards, thanked the doctor for his mediation, and acknowledged himself in the wrong for calling the image of Cot a peast, \u201cbut,\u201d said he, \u201cI spoke by metaphor, and parable, and comparison, and types; as we signify meekness by a lamb, lechery by a goat, and craftiness by a fox; so we liken ignorance to an ass, and brutality to a bear, and fury to a tiger; therefore I made use of these similes to express my sentiments (look you), and what I said before Cot, I will not unsay before man nor peast neither.\u201d\n\nOakum was so provoked at this insolence (as he termed it,) that he ordered him forthwith to be carried to the place of his confinement, and his clerk to proceed on the examination of me. The first question put to me was touching the place of my nativity, which I declared to be the north of Scotland. \u201cThe north of Ireland more like!\u201d cried the captain; \u201cbut we shall bring you up presently.\u201d He then asked what religion I professed; and when I answered \u201cthe Protestant,\u201d swore I was an arrant Roman as ever went to mass. \u201cCome, come, clerk,\u201d continued he, \u201ccatechise him a little on this subject.\u201d But before I relate the particulars of the clerk\u2019s inquiries, it will not be amiss to inform the reader that our commander himself was an Hibernian, and, if not shrewdly belied, a Roman Catholic to boot. \u201cYou say, you are a Protestant,\u201d said the clerk; \u201cmake the sign of the cross with your finger, so, and swear upon it to that affirmation.\u201d When I was about to perform the ceremony, the captain cried with some emotion, \u201cNo, no, d\u2014me! I\u2019ll have no profanation neither. But go on with your interrogations.\u201d \u201cWell then,\u201d proceeded my examiner, \u201chow many sacraments are there?\u201d To which I replied, \u201cTwo.\u201d \u201cWhat are they?\u201d said he. I answered, \u201cBaptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper.\u201d \u201cAnd so you would explode confirmation and marriage altogether?\u201d said Oakum. \u201cI thought this fellow was a rank Roman.\u201d The clerk, though he was bred under an attorney, could not refrain from blushing at this blunder, which he endeavoured to conceal, by observing, that these decoys would not do with me, who seemed to be an old offender. He went on with asking, if I believed in transubstantiation; but I treated the notion of real presence with such disrespect, that his patron was scandalised at my impiety, and commanded him to proceed to the plot. Whereupon this miserable pettifogger told me, there was great reason to suspect me of being a spy on board, and that I had entered into a conspiracy with Thompson, and others not yet detected, against the life of Captain Oakum, which accusation they pretended to support by the evidence of our boy, who declared he had often heard the deceased Thompson and me whispering together, and could distinguish the words, \u201cOakum, rascal, poison, pistol;\u201d by which expressions it appeared, we did intend to use sinister means to accomplish his destruction. That the death of Thompson seemed to confirm this conjecture, who, either feeling the stings of remorse for being engaged in such a horrid confederacy, or fearing a discovery, by which he must have infallibly suffered an ignominious death, had put a fatal period to his own existence. But what established the truth of the whole was, a book in cyphers found among my papers, which exactly tallied with one found in his chest, after his disappearance. This, he observed, was a presumption very near positive proof, and would determine any jury in Christendom to find me guilty. In my own defence, I alleged, that I had been dragged on board at first very much against my inclination, as I could prove by the evidence of some people now in the ship, consequently could have no design of becoming spy at that time; and ever since had been entirely out of the reach of any correspondence that could justly entail that suspicion upon me. As for conspiring against my captain\u2019s life, it could not be supposed that any man in his right wits would harbour the least thought of such an undertaking, which he could not possibly perform without certain infamy and ruin to himself, even if he had all the inclination in the world. That, allowing the boy\u2019s evidence to be true (which I affirmed was false and malicious), nothing conclusive could be gathered from a few incoherent words; neither was the fate of Mr. Thompson a circumstance more favourable for the charge; for I had in my pocket a letter which too well explained that mystery, in a very different manner from that which was supposed. With these words, I produced the following letter, which Jack Rattlin brought to me the very day after Thompson disappeared; and told me it was committed to his care by the deceased, who made him promise not to deliver it sooner. The clerk, taking it out of my hand, read aloud the contents, which were these;\n\n\u2018Dear Friend,\u2014I am so much oppressed with the fatigue I daily and nightly undergo, and the barbarous usage of Doctor Mackshane, who is bent on your destruction as well as mine, that I am resolved to free myself from this miserable life, and, before you receive this, shall be no more. I could have wished to die in your good opinion, which I am afraid I shall forfeit by the last act of my life; but, if you cannot acquit me, I know you will at least preserve some regard for the memory of an unfortunate young man who loved you. I recommend it to you, to beware of Mackshane, whose revenge is implacable. I wish all prosperity to you and Mr. Morgan, to whom pray offer my last respects, and beg to be remembered as your unhappy friend and countryman,\n\n\u2018William Thompson.\u2019\n\nThis letter was no sooner read, than Mackshane, in a transport of rage, snatched it out of the clerk\u2019s hands, and tore it into a thousand pieces, saying, it was a villainous forgery, contrived and executed by myself. The captain and clerk declared themselves of the same opinion, although I insisted of having the remains of it compared with other writings of Thompson, which they had in their possession; and I was ordered to answer the last article of my accusation, namely, the book of ciphers found among my papers. \u201cThat is easily done,\u201d said I. \u201cWhat you are pleased to call ciphers, are no other than the Greek characters, in which, for my amusement, I keep a diary of everything remarkable that has occurred to my observation since the beginning of the voyage, till the day in which I was put in irons; and the same method was practised by Mr. Thompson, who copied mine.\u201d \u201cA very likely story,\u201d cried Mackshane; \u201cwhat occasion was there for using Greek characters, if you were not afraid of discovering what you had wrote? But what d\u2019ye talk of Greek characters? D\u2019ye think I am so ignorant of the Greek language, as not to distinguish its letters from these, which are no more Greek than Chinese? No, no, I will not give up my knowledge of the Greek for you, nor none that ever came from your country.\u201d So saying, with an unparalleled effrontery, he repeated some gibberish, which by the sound seemed to be Irish, and made it pass for Greek with the captain, who, looking at me with a contemptuous sneer, exclaimed, \u201cAh, ah! have you caught a tartar?\u201d I could not help smiling at the consummate assurance of this Hibernian, and offered to refer the dispute to anybody on board who understood the Greek alphabet. Upon which Morgan was brought back, and, being made acquainted with the affair, took the book, and read a whole page in English, without hesitation, deciding the controversy in my favour. The doctor was so far from being out of countenance at this detection, that he affirmed Morgan was in the secret, and repeated from his own invention. Oakum said, \u201cAy, ay, I see they are both in a story;\u201d and dismissed my fellow-mate to his cockloft, although I proposed that he and I should read and translate, separately, any chapter or verse in the Greek Testament in his possession, by which it would appear whether we or the surgeon spoke truth. Not being endued with eloquence enough to convince the captain that there could be no juggle nor confederacy in this expedient, I begged to be examined by some unconcerned person on board, who understood Greek. Accordingly, the whole ship\u2019s company, officers and all, were called upon deck, among whom it was proclaimed that, if anyone of them could speak Greek, he or they so qualified should ascend the quarter-deck immediately. After some pause, two foremast men came up, and professed their skill in that language, which, they said, they acquired during several voyages to the Levant, among the Greeks of the Morea. The captain exulted much in this declaration, and put my journal book into the hands of one of them, who candidly owned he could neither read nor write; the other acknowledged the same degree of ignorance, but pretended to speak the Greek lingo with any man on board; and, addressing himself to me, pronounced some sentences of a barbarous corrupted language, which I did not understand. I asserted that the modern Greek was as different from that spoken and written by the ancients, as the English used now from the old Saxon spoke in the time of Hengist: and, as I had only learned the true original tongue, in which Homer, Pindar, the Evangelists, and other great men of antiquity wrote, it could not be supposed that I should know anything of an imperfect Gothic dialect that rose on the ruins of the former, and scarce retained any traces of the old expression: but, if Doctor Mackshane, who pretended to be master of the Greek language, could maintain a conversation with these seamen, I would retract what I had said, and be content to suffer any punishment be should think proper to inflict. I had no sooner uttered these words than the surgeon, knowing one of the fellows to be his countryman, accosted him in Irish, and was answered in the same brogue; then a dialogue ensued between them, which they affirmed to be in Greek, after having secured the secrecy of the other tar, who had his cue in the language of the Morea, from his companion, before they would venture to assert such an intrepid falsehood. \u201cI thought,\u201d said Oakum, \u201cwe should discover the imposture at last. Let the rascal be carried back to his confinement. I find he must dangle.\u201d Having nothing further to urge in my own behalf, before a court so prejudiced with spite, and fortified with ignorance against truth, I suffered myself to be reconducted peaceably to my fellow-prisoner, who, hearing the particulars of my trial, lifted up his hands and eyes to Heaven, and uttered a dreadful groan: and, not daring to disburden his thoughts to me by speech, lest he might be overheard by the sentinel, burst forth into a Welsh song, which he accompanied with a thousand contortions of face and violent gestures of body.\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nI discover a subornation against me, by means of a quarrel between two of the evidences; in consequence of which I am set at liberty, and prevail upon Morgan to accept of his freedom on the same terms\u2014Mackshane\u2019s malice\u2014we arrive at Jamaica, from whence in a short time we beat up to Hispaniola, in conjunction with the West India squadron\u2014we take in water, sail again, and arrive at Carthagena\u2014Reflections on our conduct there\n\nMeanwhile, a quarrel happening between the two modern Greeks, the one, to be revenged of the other, came and discovered to us the mystery of Mackshane\u2019s dialogue, as I have explained it above. This detection coming to the ears of the doctor, who was sensible that (now we were in sight of Jamaica) we should have an opportunity of clearing ourselves before a court-martial, and, at the same time, of making his malice and ignorance conspicuous, he interceded for us with the captain so effectually, that in a few hours we were set at liberty, and ordered to return to our duty. This was a happy event for me, my whole body being blistered by the sun, and my limbs benumbed by want of motion: but I could scarce persuade the Welshman to accept of this indulgence, he persisted in his obstinacy to remain in irons, until he should be discharged by a court-martial, which, he believed would also do him justice on his enemies. At length I represented to him the precarious issue of a trial, the power and interest of his adversaries, and flattered his revenge with the hope of wreaking his resentment with his own hands upon Mackshane after our return to England. This last argument had more weight with him than all the rest, and prevailed upon him to repair with me to the cockpit, which I no sooner entered, than the idea of my departed friend presented itself to my remembrance, and filled my eyes with tears. We discharged from our mess the boy who had acted so perfidiously, notwithstanding his tears, intreaties, and of penitence for what he had done; but not before he had confessed that the surgeon had bribed him to give evidence against us, with a pair of stockings and a couple of old check shirts, of which his servant had since plundered him.\n\nThe keys of our chests and lockers being sent to us by the doctor, we detained the messenger until we had examined the contents; and my fellow-mate, finding all his Cheshire cheese consumed to a crust, his brandy exhausted, and his onions gone, was seized with a fit of choler, which he discharged on Mackshane\u2019s man in oaths and execrations, threatening to prosecute him as a thief. The fellow swore in his turn, that he never had the keys in his possession till that time, when he received them from his master with orders to deliver them to us. \u201cAs Cot is my judge,\u201d cried Morgan, \u201cand my salfation, and my witness; whosoever has pilfered my provisions is a lousy, peggarly, rascally knave! and by the soul of my grandsire, I will impeach, and accuse, and indict him, of a roppery, if I did but know who he is.\u201d Had this misfortune happened at sea, where we could not repair the loss, in all probability this descendant of Caractacus would have lost his wits entirely; but, when I observed how easy it would be to remedy this paltry mischance, he became more calm, and reconciled himself to the occasion.\n\nA little while after this transport the surgeon came into the birth, under pretence of taking something out of the medicine chest, and, with a smiling aspect, wished us joy of our deliverance, which, he said, he had been at great pains to obtain of the captain, who was very justly incensed at our behaviour; but he, the doctor, had passed his word for our future conduct, and he hoped we should give him no cause to repent of his kindness. He expected, no doubt, an acknowledgment from us for this pretended piece of service, as well as a general amnesty of what was past; but he had to do with people who were not quite so apt to forgive injuries as he imagined, or to forget that, if our deliverance was owing to his mediation, our calamity was occasioned by his malice; I therefore sat silent, while my companion answered, \u201cAy, ay, \u2019tis no matter, Cot knows the heart; there is a time for all things, as the wise man saith; there is a time for throwing away stones, and to gather them up.\u201d He seemed to be disconcerted at this reply, and went away in a pet, muttering something about \u201cIngratitude,\u201d and \u201cFellows,\u201d of which we did not think fit to take any notice.\n\nOur fleet, having joined another that waited for us, lay at anchor about a month in the harbour of Port Royal in Jamaica, during which time something of consequence was certainly transacted; notwithstanding the insinuations of some, who affirmed we had no business at all in that place; that, in order to take the advantage of the season proper for our enterprise, the West India squadron, which had previous notice of our coming, ought to have joined us at the west end of Hispaniola, with necessary stores and refreshments, from whence we could have sailed directly for Carthagena, before the enemy could put themselves in a good posture of defence, or, indeed, have an inkling of our design. Be this as it will, we sailed from Jamaica, and, in ten days or a fortnight, beat up against the wind as far as the Isle of Vache, with an intention, as was said, to attack the French fleet, then supposed to be lying near that place; but before we arrived, they had sailed for Europe, having first dispatched an advice-boat to Carthagena, with an account of our being in those seas, as also of our strength and destination. We loitered here some days longer, taking in wood and brackish water, in the use whereof, however, our admiral seemed to consult the health of the men, by restricting each to a quart a day.\n\nAt length we set sail, and arrived in a bay to the windward of Carthagena, where we came to an anchor, and lay at our ease ten days longer. Here, again, certain malicious people took occasion to blame the conduct of their superiors, by saying, that in so doing they not only unprofitably wasted time, which was very precious, considering the approach of the rainy season, but also allowed the Spaniards to recollect themselves from a terror occasioned by the approach of an English fleet, at least three times as numerous as ever appeared in that part of the world before. But if I might be allowed to give my opinion of the matter, I would ascribe this delay to the generosity of our chiefs, who scorned to take any advantage that fortune might give them even over an enemy. At last, however, we weighed, and anchored again somewhat nearer the harbour\u2019s mouth, where we made shift to land our marines, who encamped on the beach, in despite of the enemy\u2019s shot, which knocked a good many of them on the head. This piece of conduct, in choosing a camp under the walls of an enemy\u2019s fortification, which I believe never happened before, was practised, I presume, with a view of accustoming the soldiers to stand fire, who were not as yet much used to discipline, most of them having been taken from the plough-tail a few months before. This expedient, again, has furnished matter for censure against the ministry, for sending a few raw recruits on such an important enterprise, while so many veteran regiments lay inactive at home. But surely our governors had their reasons for so doing, which possibly may be disclosed with other secrets of the deep. Perhaps they were loth to risk their best troops on such desperate service, or the colonel and the field officers of the old corps, who, generally speaking, enjoyed their commissions as sinecures or pensions, for some domestic services rendered to the court, refused to embark in such a dangerous and precarious undertaking; for which refusal, no doubt, they are to be much commended.\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nOur Land Forces being disembarked, erect a fascine battery\u2014our ship is ordered, with four more, to batter the port of Bocca Chica\u2014Mackshane\u2019s cowardice\u2014the Chaplain\u2019s frenzy\u2014honest Rattlin loses one hand\u2014his heroism and reflections on the battle\u2014Crampley\u2019s behaviour to me during the heat of the Fight\n\nOur forces being landed and stationed as I have already mentioned, set about erecting a fascine battery to cannonade the principal fort of the enemy; and in something more than three weeks, it was ready to open. That we might do the Spaniards as much honour as possible, it was determined, in a council of war, that five of our largest ships should attack the fort on one side, while the battery, strengthened by two mortars and twenty-four cohorns, should ply it on the other.\n\nAccordingly, the signal for our ship to engage, among others, was hoisted, we being advertised, the night before, to make everything clear for that purpose; and, in so doing, a difference happened between Captain Oakum and his well-beloved cousin and counsellor Mackshane, which had well nigh terminated in an open rupture. The doctor, who had imagined there was no more danger of being hurt by the enemy\u2019s shot in the cockpit than in the centre of the earth, was lately informed that a surgeon\u2019s mate had been killed in that part of the ship by a cannon-ball from two small redoubts that were destroyed before the disembarkation of our soldiers; and therefore insisted upon having a platform raised for the convenience of the sick and wounded in the after-hold, where he deemed himself more secure than on the deck above. The captain, offended at this extraordinary proposal, accused him of pusillanimity, and told him, there was no room in the hold for such an occasion: or, if there was, he could not expect to be indulged more than the rest of the surgeons of the navy, who used the cockpit for that purpose. Fear rendering Mackshane obstinate, he persisted in his demand, and showed his instructions, by which it was authorised; the captain swore these instructions were dictated by a parcel of lazy poltroons who were never at sea; nevertheless he was obliged to comply, and sent for the carpenter to give him orders about it. But, before any such measure could be taken, our signal was thrown out, and the doctor compelled to trust his carcass in the cockpit, where Morgan and I were busy in putting our instruments and dressings in order.\n\nOur ship, with others destined for this service, immediately weighed, and in less than half-an-hour came to an anchor before the castle of Bocca Chica, with a spring upon our cable, and the cannonading (which indeed was dreadful) began. The surgeon, after having crossed himself, fell flat on the deck; and the chaplain and purser, who were stationed with us in quality of assistants, followed his example, while the Welshman and I sat upon a chest looking at one another with great discomposure, scarce able to refrain from the like prostration. And that the reader may know it was not a common occasion that alarmed us thus, I must inform him of the particulars of this dreadful din that astonished us. The fire of the Spaniards proceeded from eighty-four great guns, besides a mortar and small arms, in Bocca Chica; thirty-six in Fort St. Joseph; twenty in two fascine batteries, and four men-of-war, mounting sixty-four guns each. This was answered by our land-battery mounted with twenty-one cannon, two mortars, and twenty-four cohorns, and five great ships of seventy or eighty guns, that fired without intermission.\n\nWe had not been many minutes engaged, when one of the sailors brought another on his back to the cockpit, where he tossed him down like a bag of oats, and pulling out his pouch, put a large chew of tobacco in his mouth without speaking a word. Morgan immediately examined the condition of the wounded man, and cried out, \u201cAs I shall answer now, the man is as dead as my great grandfather.\u201d \u201cDead,\u201d said his comrade; \u201che may be dead now, for aught I know, but I\u2019ll be d\u2014d if he was not alive when I took him up.\u201d So saying, he was about to return to his quarters, when I bade him carry the body along with him, and throw it overboard. \u201cD\u2014n the body!\u201d said he, \u201cI think \u2019tis fair enough if I take care of my own.\u201d My fellow mate, snatching up the amputation knife, pursued him half-way up the cock-pit ladder, crying, \u201cYou lousy rascal, is this the churchyard, or the charnel-house, or the sepulchre, or the golgotha, of the ship?\u201d\u2014but was stopped in his career by one calling, \u201cYo he, avast there\u2014scaldings!\u201d \u201cScaldings!\u201d answered Morgan; \u201cCot knows \u2019tis hot enough indeed: who are you?\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s one!\u201d replied the voice; and I immediately knew it to be that of my honest friend Jack Rattlin, who coming towards me, told me, with great deliberation, he was come to be docked at last, and discovered the remains of one hand, which had been shattered to pieces with a grape shot. I lamented with unfeigned sorrow his misfortune, which he bore with heroic courage, observing, that every shot had its commission: \u201cIt was well it did not take him in the head! or if it had, what then? he should have died bravely, fighting for his king and country. Death was a debt which every man owed, and must pay; and that now was as well as another time.\u201d I was much pleased and edified with the maxims of this sea-philosopher, who endured the amputation of his left hand without shrinking, the operation being performed (at his request) by me, after Mackshane, who was with difficulty prevailed to lift his head from the deck, had declared there was a necessity for his losing the limb.\n\nWhile I was employed in dressing the stump, I asked Jack\u2019s opinion of the battle, who, shaking his head, frankly told me, he believed we should do no good: \u201cFor why? because, instead of dropping anchor close under shore, where we should have to deal with one corner of Bocca Chica only, we had opened the harbour, and exposed ourselves to the whole fire of the enemy from their shipping and Fort St. Joseph, as well as from the castle we intended to cannonade; that, besides, we lay at too great a distance to damage the walls, and three parts in four of our shot did not take place; for there was scarce anybody on board who understood the pointing of a gun. Ah! God help us!\u201d continued he, \u201cIf your kinsman, Lieutenant Bowling, had been here, we should have had other guess work.\u201d By this time, our patients had increased to such a number, that we did not know which to begin with; and the first mate plainly told the surgeon, that if he did not get up immediately and perform his duty, he would complain of his behaviour to the admiral, and make application for his warrant. This remonstrance effectually roused Mackshane, who was never deaf to an argument in which he thought his interest was concerned; he therefore rose up, and in order to strengthen his resolution, had recourse more than once to a case-bottle of rum, which he freely communicated to the chaplain, and purser, who had as much need of such extraordinary inspiration as himself. Being thus supported, he went to work, and arms and legs were hewed down without mercy. The fumes of the liquor mounting into the parson\u2019s brain, conspired, with his former agitation of spirits, to make him quite delirious; he stripped himself to the skin; and, besmearing his body with blood, could scarce be withheld from running upon deck in that condition. Jack Rattlin, scandalised at this deportment, endeavoured to allay his transports with reason; but finding all he said ineffectual, and great confusion occasioned by his frolics, he knocked him down with his right hand, and by threats kept him quiet in that state of humiliation. But it was not in the power of rum to elevate the purser, who sat on the floor wringing his hands, and cursing the hour in which he left his peaceable profession of a brewer in Rochester, to engage in such a life of terror and disquiet.\n\nWhile we diverted ourselves at the expense of this poor devil, a shot happened to take us between wind and water, and (its course being through the purser\u2019s store room) made a terrible havoc and noise among the jars and bottles in its way, and disconcerted Mackshane so much, that he dropped his scalpel, and falling down on his knees, pronounced his Pater-noster aloud: the purser fell backward, and lay without sense or motion; and the chaplain grew so outrageous, that Rattlin with one hand could not keep him under; so that we were obliged to confine him in the surgeon\u2019s cabin, where he was no doubt guilty of a thousand extravagancies. Much about this time, my old antagonist, Crampley, came down, with express orders, as he said, to bring me up to the quarter-deck, to dress a slight wound the captain had received by a splinter: his reason for honouring me in particular with this piece of service, being, that in case I should be killed or disabled by the way, my death or mutilation would be of less consequence to the ship\u2019s company than that of the doctor or his first mate. At another time, perhaps, I might have disputed this order, to which I was not bound to pay the least regard; but as I thought my reputation depended upon my compliance, I was resolved to convince my rival that I was no more afraid than he of exposing myself to danger. With this view I provided myself with dressings, and followed him immediately to the quarter-deck, through a most infernal scene of slaughter, fire, smoke, and uproar. Captain Oakum, who leaned against the mizen-mast, no sooner saw me approach in my shirt, with the sleeves tucked up to my armpits, and my hands dyed with blood, than he signified his displeasure by a frown, and asked why the doctor himself did not come? I told him that Crampley had singled me out, as if by express command; at which reply he seemed surprised, and threatened to punish the midshipman for his presumption, after the engagement. In the meantime, I was sent back to my station, and ordered to tell Mackshane, that the captain expected him immediately. I got safe back, and delivered my commission to the doctor, who flatly refused to quit the post assigned to him by his instructions; whereupon Morgan, who I believe, was jealous of my reputation for courage, undertook the affair, and ascended with great intrepidity. The captain, finding the surgeon obstinate, suffered himself to be dressed, and swore he would confine Mackshane as soon as the service should be over.\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nA breach being made in the walls, our soldiers give the assault, and take the place without opposition\u2014our sailors at the same time, become masters of all the other strengths near Bocca Chica, and take possession of the harbour\u2014the good consequence of this success\u2014we move nearer the town\u2014find two forts deserted, and the Channel blocked up with sunk vessels; which however we find means to clear\u2014land our soldiers at La Quinta\u2014repulse a body of militia\u2014attack the castle of St. Lazar, and are forced to retreat with great loss\u2014the remains of our army are re-embarked\u2014an effort of the Admiral to take the town\u2014the economy of our expedition described\n\nHaving cannonaded the fort during the space of four hours, we were all ordered to slip our cables, and sheer off; but next day the engagement was renewed, and continued from the morning till the afternoon, when the enemy\u2019s fire from Bocca Chica slackened, and towards evening was quite silenced. A breach being made on the other side, by our land battery, large enough to admit a middle-sized baboon, provided he could find means to climb up to it, our general proposed to give the assault that very night, and actually ordered a detachment on that duty. Providence stood our friend upon this occasion, and put it into the hearts of the Spaniards to abandon the fort, which might have been maintained by resolute men till the day of judgment against all the force we could exert in the attack. And while our soldiers took possession of the enemy\u2019s ramparts without resistance, the same good luck attended a body of sailors, who made themselves masters of Fort St. Joseph, the fascine batteries, and one Spanish man-of-war; the other three being burnt or sunk by the foe, that they might not fall into our hands. The taking of these forts, in the strength of which the Spaniards chiefly confided, made us masters of the outward harbour, and occasioned great joy among us, as we laid our accounts at finding little or no opposition from the town: and indeed, if a few great ships had sailed up immediately, before they had recovered from the confusion and despair that our unexpected success had produced among them, it is not impossible that we might have finished the affair to our satisfaction, without any more bloodshed; but this step our heroes disdained as a barbarous insult over the enemy\u2019s distress, and gave them all the respite they could desire, in order to recollect themselves. In the meantime, Mackshane, taking the advantage of this general exultation, waited on our captain, and pleaded his own cause so effectually that he was re-established in his good graces; and as for Crampley, there was no more notice taken of his behaviour towards me during the action. But of all the consequences of the victory, none was more grateful than plenty of fresh water, after we had languished five weeks on the allowance of a purser\u2019s quart per day for each man in the Torrid Zone, where the sun was vertical, and the expense of bodily fluid so great, that a gallon of liquor could scarce supply the waste of twenty-four hours; especially as our provision consisted of putrid salt beef, to which the sailors gave the name of Irish horse; salt pork, of New England, which, though neither fish nor flesh, savoured of both; bread from the same country, every biscuit whereof, like a piece of clockwork, moved by its own internal impulse, occasioned by the myriads of insects that dwelt within it; and butter served out by the gill, that tasted like train oil thickened with salt. Instead of small beer, each man was allowed three half-quarterns of brandy or rum, which were distributed every morning, diluted with a certain quantity of his water, without either sugar or fruit to render it palatable, for which reason, this composition was by the sailors not ineptly styled Necessity. Nor was this limitation of simple element owing to a scarcity of it on board, for there was at this time water enough in the ship for a voyage of six months, at the rate of half-a-gallon per day to each man: but this fast must, I suppose, have been enjoined by way of penance on the ship\u2019s company for their sins; or rather with a view to mortify them into a contempt of life, that they might thereby become more resolute and regardless of danger. How simply then do those people argue, who ascribe the great mortality among us, to our bad provision and want of water; and affirm, that a great many valuable lives might have been saved, if the useless transports had been employed in fetching fresh stock, turtle, fruit, and other refreshments from Jamaica and other adjacent islands, for the use of the army and fleet! seeing it is to be hoped, that those who died went to a better place, and those who survived were the more easily maintained. After all, a sufficient number remained to fall before the walls of St. Lazar, where they behaved like their own country mastiffs, which shut their eyes, run into the jaws of a bear, and have their heads crushed for their valour.\n\nBut to return to my narration. After having put garrisons into the forts we had taken, and re-embarked our soldiers and artillery (a piece of service that detained us more than a week), we ventured up to the mouth of the inner harbour, guarded by a large fortification on one side, and a small redoubt on the other, both of which were deserted before our approach, and the entrance of the harbour blocked up by several old galleons, and two men-of-war that the enemy had sunk in the channel. We made shift, however, to open a passage for some ships, that favoured a second landing of our troops at a place called La Quinta, not far from the town, where, after a faint resistance from a body of Spaniards, who opposed their disembarkation, they encamped with a design of besieging the castle of St. Lazar, which overlooked and commanded the city. Whether our renowned general had nobody in his army who knew how to approach it in form, or that he trusted entirely to the fame of his arms, I shall not determine; but, certain it is, a resolution was taken in a council of war, to attack the place with musketry only. This was put in execution, and succeeded accordingly; the enemy giving them such a hearty reception, that the greatest part of their detachment took up their everlasting residence on the spot.\n\nOur chief, not relishing this kind of complaisance in the Spaniard\u2019s, was wise enough to retreat on board with the remains of his army, which, from eight thousand able men landed on the beach near Bocca Chica, was now reduced to fifteen hundred fit for service. The sick and wounded were squeezed into certain vessels, which thence obtained the name of hospital ships, though methinks they scarce deserved such a creditable title, seeing few of them could boast of their surgeon, nurse, or cook; and the space between decks was so confined that the miserable patients had not room to sit upright in their beds. Their wounds and stumps, being neglected, contracted filth and putrefaction, and millions of maggots were hatched amidst the corruption of their sores. This inhuman disregard was imputed to the scarcity of surgeons; though it is well known that every great ship in the fleet could have spared one at least for this duty, an expedient which would have been more than sufficient to remove this shocking inconvenience. But perhaps our general was too much of a gentleman to ask a favour of this kind from his fellow chief, who, on the other hand, would not derogate so much from his own dignity, as to offer such assistance unasked; for, I may venture to affirm, that by this time the Demon of Discord, with her sooty wings, had breathed her influence upon our councils; and it might be said of these great men (I hope they will pardon the comparison) as of Cesar and Pompey, the one could not brook a superior, and the other was impatient of an equal; so that, between the pride of one and insolence of another, the enterprise miscarried, according to the proverb, \u201cBetween two stools the backside falls to the ground.\u201d Not that I would be thought to liken any public concern to that opprobrious part of the human body, though I might with truth assert, if I durst use such a vulgar idiom, that the nation did hang on arse at its disappointment on this occasion; neither would I presume to compare the capacity of our heroic leaders to any such wooden convenience as a joint-stool or a close-stool; but only to signify by this simile, the mistake the people committed in trusting to the union of two instruments that were never joined.\n\nA day or two after the attempt on St. Lazar, the admiral ordered one of the Spanish men-of-war we had taken to be mounted with sixteen guns, and manned with detachments from our great ships, in order to batter the town; accordingly, she was towed into the inner harbour in the night, and moored within half a mile of the walls, against which she began to fire at daybreak; and continued about six hours exposed to the opposition of at least thirty pieces of cannon, which at length obliged our men to set her on fire, and get off as well as they could in their boats. This piece of conduct afforded matter of speculation to all the wits, either in the army or navy, who were at last fain to acknowledge it a stroke of policy above their comprehension. Some entertained such an irreverent opinion of the admiral\u2019s understanding, as to think he expected the town would surrender to his floating battery of sixteen guns: others imagined his sole intention was to try the enemy\u2019s strength, by which he should be able to compute the number of great ships that would be necessary to force the town to a capitulation. But this last conjecture soon appeared groundless, inasmuch as no ships of any kind whatever were afterwards employed on that service. A third sort swore, that no other cause could be assigned for this undertaking than that which induced Don Quixote to attack the windmill. A fourth class (and that the most numerous, though, without doubt, composed of the sanguine and malicious), plainly taxed this commander with want of honesty as well as sense; and alleged that he ought to have sacrificed private pique to the interest of his country; that, where the lives of so many brave fellow-citizens were concerned, he ought to have concurred with the general without being solicited or even desired, towards their preservation and advantage, that, if his arguments could not dissuade him from a desperate enterprise, it was his duty to have rendered it as practicable as possible, without running extreme hazard; that this could have been done, with a good prospect of success, by ordering five or six large ships to batter the town, while the land forces stormed the castle; by these means a considerable diversion would have been made in favour of those troops, who, in their march to the assault and in the retreat, suffered much more from the town than from the castle! that the inhabitants, seeing themselves vigorously attacked on all hands, would have been divided, distracted, and confused, and in all probability, unable to resist the assailants. But all these suggestions surely proceeded from ignorance or malevolence, or else the admiral would not have found it such an easy matter, at his return to England, to justify his conduct to a ministry at once so upright and discerning. True it is, that those who undertook to vindicate him on the spot, asserted, that there was not water enough for our great ships near the town: though this was a little unfortunately urged, because there happened to be pilots in the fleet perfectly well acquainted with the soundings of the harbour, who affirmed there was water enough for five eighty-gun ships to lie abreast almost up to the very walls. The disappointments we suffered occasioned a universal dejection, which was not at all alleviated by the objects that daily and hourly entertained our eyes, nor by the prospect of what must have inevitably happened, had we remained much longer in this place. Such was the economy in some ships that, rather than be at the trouble of interring the dead, their commanders ordered their men to throw their bodies overboard, many without either ballast or winding-sheet; so that numbers of human carcases floated in the harbour, until they were devoured by sharks and carrion crows, which afforded no agreeable spectacle to those who survived. At the same time the wet season began, during which a deluge of rain falls, from the rising to the setting sun, without intermission, and that no sooner ceases than it begins to thunder, and lighten with such continued flashing, that one can see to read a very small print by the illumination.\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nAn epidemic Fever rages among us\u2014we abandon our Conquests\u2014I am seized with Distemper\u2014write a Petition to the Captain, which is rejected\u2014I am in danger of Suffocation through the Malice of Crampley, and relieved by a Serjeant\u2014my Fever increases\u2014the Chaplain wants to confess me\u2014I obtain a favourable Crisis\u2014Morgan\u2019s Affection for me proved\u2014the Behaviour of Mackshane and Crampley towards me\u2014Captain Oakum is removed into another Ship with his beloved Doctor\u2014our new Captain described\u2014An Adventure of Morgan\n\nThe change of the atmosphere, occasioned by this phenomenon, conspired, with the stench that surrounded us, the heat of the climate, our own constitutions, impoverished by bad provisions, and our despair, to introduce the bilious fever among us, which raged with such violence, that three-fourths of those whom it invaded died in a deplorable manner; the colour of their skin being, by the extreme putrefaction of the juices, changed into that of soot.\n\nOur conductors, finding things in this situation, perceived it was high to relinquish our conquests, and this we did, after having rendered their artillery useless, and blown up their walls with gunpowder. Just as we sailed from Bocca Chica, on our return to Jamaica, I found myself threatened with the symptoms of this terrible distemper; and knowing very well that I stood no chance for my life, if I should be obliged to be in the cockpit, which by this time was grown intolerable, even to people in health, by reason of the heat and unwholesome smell of decayed provision, I wrote a petition to the captain, representing my case, and humbly imploring his permission to be among the soldiers in the middle deck, for the benefit of the air: but I might have spared myself the trouble; for this humane commander refused my request, and ordered me to continue in the place allotted for the surgeon\u2019s mates, or else be contented to be in the hospital, which, by the by, was three degrees more offensive and more suffocating than our own berth below. Another, in my condition, perhaps, would have submitted to his fate, and died in a pet; but I could not brook the thought of perishing so pitifully, after I had weathered so many gales of hard fortune: I therefore, without minding Oakum\u2019s injunction, prevailed upon the soldiers (whose good-will I had acquired) to admit my hammock among them; and actually congratulated myself upon my comfortable situation; which Crampley no sooner understood, than he signified to the captain my contempt of his orders, and was invested with power to turn me down again into my proper habitation.\n\nThis barbarous piece of revenge incensed me so much against the author, that I vowed, with bitter imprecations, to call him to a severe account, if ever it should be in my power; and the agitation of my spirits increased my fever to a violent degree. While I lay gasping for breath in this infernal abode, I was visited by a sergeant, the bones of whose nose I had reduced and set to rights, after they had been demolished by a splinter during our last engagement; he, being informed of my condition, offered me the use of his berth in the middle deck, which was enclosed with canvas, and well aired by a port-hole that remained open within it. I embraced this proposal with joy, and was immediately conducted to the place, where I was treated, while my illness lasted, with the utmost tenderness and care by this grateful halberdier, who had no other bed for himself than a hencoop during the whole passage. Here I lay and enjoyed the breeze, notwithstanding which my malady gained ground, and at length my life was despaired of, though I never lost hopes of recovery, even when I had the mortification to see, from my cabin-window, six or seven thrown overboard every day, who died of the same distemper. This confidence, I am persuaded, conduced a great deal to the preservation of my life, especially when joined to another resolution I took at the beginning, namely, to refuse all medicine, which I could not help thinking co-operated with the disease, and, instead of resisting putrefaction, promoted a total degeneracy of the vital fluid. When my friend Morgan, therefore, brought his diaphoretic bolases, I put them into my mouth, \u2019tis true, but without any intention of swallowing them: and, when he went away, spit them out, and washed my mouth with water-gruel. I seemingly complied in this matter, that I might not affront the blood of Caractacus, by a refusal which might have intimated a diffidence of his physical capacity, for he acted as my physician; Doctor Mackshane never once inquiring about me, or even knowing where I was. When my distemper was at the height, Morgan thought my case desperate, and, after having applied a blister to the nape of my neck, squeezed my hand, bidding me, with a woful countenance, recommend myself to Cot and my Reteemer; then, taking his leave, desired the chaplain to come and administer some spiritual consolation to me; but, before he arrived, I made shift to rid myself of the troublesome application the Welshman had bestowed on my back. The person, having felt my pulse, inquired into the nature of my complaints, hemmed a little, and began thus: \u201cMr. Random, God out of his infinite mercy has been pleased to visit you with a dreadful distemper, the issue of which no man knows. You may be permitted to recover and live many days on the face of the earth; and, which is more probable, you may be taken away, and cut off in the flower of your youth. It is incumbent on you, therefore, to prepare for the great change, by repenting sincerely of your sins; of this there cannot be a greater sign, than an ingenuous confession, which I conjure you to make without hesitation or mental reservation; and, when I am convinced of your sincerity, I will then give you such comfort as the situation of your soul will admit of. Without doubt, you have been guilty of numberless transgressions to which youth is subject, as swearing, drunkenness, whoredom, and adultery: tell me therefore, without reserve, the particulars of each, especially of the last, that I may be acquainted with the true state of your conscience; for no physician will prescribe for his patient until he knows the circumstances of his disease.\u201d\n\nAs I was not under any apprehensions of death, I could not help smiling at the chaplain\u2019s inquisitive remonstrance, which I told him savoured more of the Roman than of the Protestant church, in recommending auricular confession; a thing, in my opinion, not at all necessary to salvation, and which, for that reason, I declined. This reply disconcerted him a little; however, he explained away his meaning, in making learned distinctions between what was absolutely necessary and what was only convenient; then proceeded to ask what religion I professed. I answered, that I had not as yet considered the difference of religions, consequently had not fixed on any one in particular, but that I was bred a Presbyterian. At this word the chaplain expressed great astonishment, and said, he could not comprehend how a presbyterian was entitled to any post under the English government. Then he asked if I had ever received the sacrament, or taken the oaths; to which questions, I replying in the negative, he held up his hands, assured me he could do me no service, wished I might not be in a state of reprobation, and returned to his messmates, who were making merry in the ward-room, round a table well stored with bumbo(2) and wine.\n\n(2)bumbo is a liquor composed of rum, sugar, water, and nutmeg\n\nThis insinuation, terrible as it was, had not such an effect upon me as the fever, which, soon after he had left me, grew outrageous. I began to see strange chimeras and concluded myself upon the point of being delirious; in the meantime, being in great danger of suffocation, I started up in a kind of frantic fit, with an intention to plunge myself into the sea; and, as my friend the sergeant was not present, would certainly have cooled myself to some purpose, had I not perceived a moisture upon my thigh, as I endeavoured to get out of my hammock: the appearance of this revived my hopes, and I had reflection and resolution enough to take the advantage of this favourable symptom, by tearing the shirt from my body, and the sheets from my bed, and wrapping myself in a thick blanket, in which inclosure, for about a quarter of an hour, felt all the pains of hell: but it was not long before I was recompensed for my suffering by a profuse sweat, that, bursting from the whole surface of my skin, in less than two hours, relieved me from all my complaints except that of weakness; and left me as hungry as a kite. I enjoyed a very comfortable nap, after which I was regaling myself with the agreeable reverie of future happiness, when I heard Morgan, on the outside of the curtain, ask the sergeant if I was alive still? \u201cAlive!\u201d cried the other, \u201cGod forbid he should be otherwise! he has lain quiet these five hours, and I do not choose to disturb him, for sleep will do him great service.\u201d \u201cAy,\u201d said my fellow-mate, \u201che sleeps so sound (look you), that he will not waken till the great trump plows\u2014Cot be merciful to his soul. He has paid his debt like an honest man\u2014ay, and moreover, he is at rest from all persecutions, and troubles, and afflictions, of which, Cot knows, and I know, he had his own share\u2014Ochree! Ochree! he was a promising youth indeed!\u201d So saying he groaned grievously, and began to whine in such a manner, as persuaded me he had a real friendship for me. The sergeant, alarmed at his words, came into the berth, and, while he looked upon me, I smiled, and tipped him the wink: he immediately guessed my meaning and remaining silent, Morgan was confirmed in his opinion of my being dead; whereupon he approached, with tears in his eyes, in order to indulge his grief with a sight of the object: and I counterfeited death so well, by fixing my eyes and dropping my under-jaw, that he said, \u201cThere he lies, no petter than a lump of clay, Cot help me!\u201d and observed, by the distortion of my face, that I must have had a strong struggle.\n\nI should not have been able to contain myself much longer, when he began to perform the last duty of a friend, in closing my eyes and my mouth, upon which I suddenly snapped at his fingers and discomposed him so much that he started back, turned pale as ashes, and stared like the picture of horror; although I could not help laughing at his appearance, I was concerned for his situation, and stretched out my hand, telling him I hoped to live and eat some salmagundy of his making in England. It was some time before he could recollect himself so far as to feel my pulse, and inquire into the particulars of my disease; but when he found I had enjoyed a favourable crisis, he congratulated me upon my good fortune; not failing to ascribe it, under Cot, to the blister he had applied to my back, at his last visit; which, by the bye, said he, must now be removed and dressed; he was actually going to fetch dressings, when I, feigning astonishment, said, \u201cBless me! sure you never applied a blister to me\u2014there is nothing on my back, I assure you.\u201d But he could not be convinced till he had examined it, and then endeavoured to conceal his confusion, by expressing his surprise in finding the skin untouched and the plaster missing. In order to excuse myself for paying so little regard to his prescription, I pretended to have been insensible when it was put on, and to have pulled it off afterwards in a fit of delirium. This apology satisfied my friend, who, on this occasion, abated a good deal of his stiffness in regard to punctilio; and as we were now safely arrived at Jamaica, where I had the benefit of fresh provisions and other refreshments, I recovered strength every day, and, in a short time, my health and vigour were perfectly re-established.\n\nWhen I got up at first, and was just able to crawl about the deck with a staff in my hand, I met Doctor Mackshane, who passed by me with a disdainful look, and did not vouchsafe to honour me with one word. After him came Crampley, who, strutting up to me with a fierce countenance, pronounced, \u201cHere\u2019s fine discipline on-board, when such lazy, skulking sons of bitches as you are allowed, on pretence of sickness, to lollop at your ease, while your betters are kept to hard duty!\u201d The sight and behaviour of this malicious scoundrel enraged me so much that I could scarce refrain from laying my cudgel across his pate; but when I considered my present feebleness, and the enemies I had in the ship, who wanted only a pretence to ruin me, I restrained my passion, and contented myself with telling him, I had not forgot his insolence and malice, and that I hoped we should meet one day on shore. At this declaration he grinned, shook his fist, and swore he longed for nothing more than such an opportunity. Meanwhile our ship was ordered to be heaved down, victualled, and watered, for her return to England; and our captain, for some reason or other, not thinking it convenient for him to revisit his native country at this time, exchanged with a gentleman, who, on the other hand, wished for nothing so much as to be safe without the tropic: all his care and tenderness of himself being insufficient to preserve his complexion from the injuries of the sun and weather.\n\nOur tyrant having left the ship, and carried his favourite Mackshane along with him, to my inexpressible satisfaction, our new commander came on board in a ten-oared barge, overshadowed with a vast umbrella, and appeared in everything the reverse of Oakum, being a tall, thin young man, dressed in this manner: a white hat, garnished with a red feather, adorned his head, from whence his hair flowed upon his shoulders, in ringlets tied behind with a ribbon. His coat, consisting of pink-coloured silk, lined with white, by the elegance of the cut retired backward, as it were, to discover a white satin waistcoat embroidered with gold, unbuttoned at the upper part to display a brooch set with garnets, that glittered in the breast of his shirt, which was of the finest cambric, edged with right Mechlin: the knees of his crimson velvet breeches scarce descended so low as to meet his silk stockings, which rose without spot or wrinkle on his meagre legs, from shoes of blue Meroquin, studded with diamond buckles that flamed forth rivals to the sun! A steel-hilted sword, inlaid with gold, and decked with a knot of ribbon which fell down in a rich tassel, equipped his side; and an amber-headed cane hung dangling from his wrist. But the most remarkable parts of his furniture were, a mask on his face, and white gloves on his hands, which did not seem to be put on with an intention to be pulled off occasionally, but were fixed with a curious ring on the little finger of each hand.\n\nIn this garb, Captain Whiffle, for that was his name, took possession of the ship, surrounded with a crowd of attendants, all of whom, in their different degrees, seemed to be of their patron\u2019s disposition; and the air was so impregnated with perfumes, that one may venture to affirm the climate of Arabia Felix was not half so sweet-scented. My fellow-mate, observing no surgeon among his train, thought he had found an occasion too favourable for himself to be neglected; and, remembering the old proverb, \u201cSpare to speak, and spare to speed,\u201d resolved to solicit the new captain\u2019s interest immediately, before any other surgeon could be appointed for the ship. With this view he repaired to the cabin in his ordinary dress, consisting of a check shirt and trousers, a brown linen waistcoat, and a nightcap of the same (neither of them very clean,) which, for his further misfortune, happened to smell strong of tobacco. Entering without any ceremony into this sacred place, he found Captain Whiffle reposing upon a couch, with a wrapper of fine chintz about his body, and a muslin cap bordered with lace about his head; and after several low congees began in this manner: \u201cSir, I hope you will forgive, and excuse, and pardon, the presumption of one who has not the honour of being known to you, but who is, nevertheless a shentleman porn and pred, and moreover has had misfortunes, Cot help me, in the world.\u201d\n\nHere he was interrupted by the captain, who, on seeing him, had started up with great amazement, at the novelty of the apparition; and, having recollected himself, pronounced with a look and tone signifying disdain, curiosity and surprise, \u201cZauns! who art thou?\u201d \u201cI am surgeon\u2019s first mate on board of this ship,\u201d replied Morgan: \u201cand I most vehemently desire and beseech you, with all submission, to be pleased to condescend and vouchsafe to inquire into my character, and my pehaviour, and my deserts, which, under Cot, I hope, will entitle me to the vacancy of surgeon.\u201d As he proceeded in his speech, he continued advancing towards the captain, whose nostrils were no sooner saluted with the aromatic flavour that exhaled from him, than he cried with great emotion, \u201cHeaven preserve me! I am suffocated! Fellow, fellow, away with thee! Curse thee, fellow! Get thee gone! I shall be stunk to death!\u201d At the noise of his outcries, his servants ran into his apartment, and he accosted them thus: \u201cVillains! cut-throats! traitors! I am betrayed! I am sacrificed! Will you not carry that monster away? or must I be stifled with the stench of him? oh, oh!\u201d With these interjections he sank down upon his settee in a fit: his valet-de-chambre plied him with a smelling-bottle, one footman chafed his temples with Hungary water, another sprinkled the floor with spirits of lavender, a third pushed Morgan out of the cabin; who coming to the place where I was, sat down with a demure countenance and, according to his custom, when he received any indignity which he durst not revenge, began to sing a Welsh ditty.\n\nI guessed he was under some agitation of spirits and desired to know the cause; but, instead of answering me directly, he asked with great emotion, if I thought him a monster and a stinkard? \u201cA monster and a stinkard!\u201d said I, with some surprise: \u201cdid anybody call you so?\u201d \u201cCot is my judge,\u201d replied be, \u201cCaptain Fifle did call me both; ay, and all the waters in the Tawy will not wash it out of my remembrance. I do affirm and avouch, and maintain, with my soul, and my pody, and my plood, look you, that I have no smells apout me, but such as a Christian ought to have, except the effluvia of tobacco, which is a cephalic, odoriferous, aromatic herb; and he is a son of a mountain goat who says otherwise. As for my being a minister, let that be as it is: I am as Cot was pleased to create me, which, peradventure, is more than I shall ever aver of him who gave me that title; for I will proclaim it before the world, that he is disguised, and transfigured, and transmogrified, with affectation and whimseys; and that he is more like a papoon than of the human race.\u201d\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nCaptain Whiffle sends for me\u2014his situation described\u2014his surgeon arrives, prescribes for him, and puts him to bed\u2014a bed is put up for Mr. Simper contiguous to the state room, which, with other parts of the captains behaviour, gives the ship\u2019s company a very unfavourable idea of their commander\u2014I am detained in the West Indies by the admiral, and go on board of the Lizard sloop of war in quality of surgeon\u2019s mate, where I make myself known to the surgeon, who treats me very kindly\u2014I go on shore, sell my ticket, purchase necessaries, and, at my return on board, am surprised at the sight of Crampley, who is appointed lieutenant of the sloop\u2014we sail on a cruise\u2014take a prize in which I arrive at Port Morant under the command of my messmate, with whom I live in great harmony\n\nHe was going on with an eulogium upon the captain, when I received a message to clean myself, and go up to the great cabin: and with this command I instantly complied, sweetening myself with rosewater from the medicine chest. When I entered the room, I was ordered to stand by the door, until Captain Whiffle had reconnoitered me at a distance with a spy-glass. He, having consulted one sense in this manner, bade me advance gradually, that his nose might have intelligence before it could be much offended: I therefore approached with great caution and success, and he was pleased to say, \u201cAy, this creature is tolerable.\u201d I found him lolling on his couch with a languishing air, his head supported by his valet-de-chambre, who from time to time applied a smelling-bottle to his nose. \u201cVergette,\u201d said he in a squeaking tone, \u201cdost think this wretch (meaning me) will do me no injury? May I venture to submit my arm to him?\u201d \u201cPon my word,\u201d replied the valet, \u201cI do tink dat dere be great occasion for your honour losing a small quantite of blodt; and the young man ave quelque chose of de bonne mine.\u201d \u201cWell, then,\u201d said his master, \u201cI think I must venture.\u201d Then, addressing himself to me, \u201cHast thou ever blooded anybody but brutes? But I need not ask thee, for thou wilt tell me a most d\u2014able lie,\u201d \u201cBrutes, sir!\u201d answered I, pulling down his glove, in order to feel his pulse, \u201cI never meddle with brutes.\u201d \u201cWhat the devil art thou about?\u201d cried he, \u201cdost thou intend to twist off my hand? Gad\u2019s curse! my arm is benumbed up to the very shoulder! Heaven have mercy upon me! must I perish under the hands of savages? What an unfortunate dog was I to come on board without my own surgeon, Mr. Simper.\u201d I craved pardon for having handled him so roughly, and, with the utmost care, and tenderness, tied up his arm with a fillet of silk. While I was feeling for the vein, he desired to know how much blood I intended to take from him, and, when I answered, \u201cnot above twelve ounces,\u201d started up with a look full of horror, and bade me be gone, swearing I had a design upon his life. Vergette appeased him with difficulty, and, opening a bureau, took out a pair of scales, in one of which was placed a small cup; and putting them into my hand, told me, the captain never lost above an ounce and three drams at one time.\n\nWhile I prepared for this important evacuation, there came into the cabin a young man gaily dressed, of a very delicate complexion with a kind of languid smile on his face: which seemed to have been rendered habitual by a long course of affectation. The captain no sooner perceived him, than, rising hastily, he flew into his arms, crying, \u201cO, my dear Simper, I am excessively disordered! I have been betrayed, frighted, murdered, by the negligence of my servants, who suffered a beast, a mule, a bear, to surprise me, and stink me into convulsions with the fumes of tobacco.\u201d Simper, who by this time, I found, was obliged to act for the clearness of his complexion, assumed an air of softness and sympathy, and lamented with many tender expressions of sorrow, the sad accident that had thrown him into that condition; then, feeling his patient\u2019s pulse on the outside of his glove, gave it as his opinion, that his disorder was entirely nervous, and that some drops of tincture of castor, and liquid laudanum, would be of more service to him than bleeding, by bridling the inordinate sallies of his spirits, and composing the fermentation of his bile. I was therefore sent to prepare this prescription, which was administered in a glass of sack posset, after the captain had been put to bed, and orders sent to the officers on the quarter-deck, to let nobody walk on that side under which he lay.\n\nWhile the captain enjoyed his repose the doctor watched over him, and indeed became so necessary, that a cabin was made for him contiguous to the state room where Whiffle slept, that he might be at hand in case of accidents in the night. Next day, our commander being happily recovered, gave orders that none of the lieutenants should appear upon deck without a wig, sword, and ruffles; nor any midshipman, or other petty officer, be seen with a check shirt or dirty linen. He also prohibited any person whatever, except Simper and his own servants, from coming into the great cabin without first sending in to obtain leave. These singular regulations did not prepossess the ship\u2019s company in his favour: but, on the contrary, gave scandal an opportunity to be very busy with his character, and accuse him of maintaining a correspondence with his surgeon not fit to be named.\n\nIn a few weeks, our ship being under sailing orders, I was in hope of revisiting my native country, in a very short time, when the admiral\u2019s surgeon came on board, and, sending for Morgan and me to the quarter-deck, gave us to understand there was a great scarcity of surgeons in the West Indies; that he was commanded to detain one mate out of every great ship that was bound for England; and desired us to agree between ourselves, before the next day at that hour, which of us should stay behind. We were thunderstruck at this proposal, and stared at one another some time without speaking; at length the Welshman broke silence, and offered to remain in the West Indies, provided the admiral would give him a surgeon\u2019s warrant immediately; but he was told there was no want of chief surgeons, and that he must be contented with the station of mate, till he should be further provided for in due course. Whereupon Morgan flatly refused to quit the ship for which the commissioners of the navy had appointed him; and the other told him as plainly, that if we could not determine the affair by ourselves before to-morrow morning, he must cast lots, and abide by his chance.\n\nWhen I recalled to my remembrance the miseries I had undergone in England, where I had not one friend to promote my interest, or favour my advancement in the navy, and the same time reflected on the present dearth of surgeons in the West Indies, and the unhealthiness of the climate, which every day almost reduced the number, I could not help thinking my success would be much more certain and expeditious by my staying where I was, than by returning to Europe. I therefore resolved to comply with a good grace, and next day, when we were ordered to throw dice, told Morgan he needed not trouble himself, for I would voluntarily submit to the admiral\u2019s pleasure. This frank declaration was commended by the gentleman, who assured me, it should not fare the worse with me for my resignation. Indeed he was as good as his word, and that very afternoon procured a warrant, appointing me surgeon\u2019s mate of the Lizard sloop-of-war, which put me on a footing with every first mate in the service.\n\nMy ticket being made out, I put my chest and bedding on board a canoe that lay alongside, and, having shook hands with my trusty friend the sergeant, and honest Jack Rattlin, who was bound for Greenwich Hospital, I took my leave of Morgan with many tears, after we had exchanged our sleeve buttons as remembrances of each other. Having presented my new warrant to the captain of the Lizard, I inquired for the doctor, whom I no sooner saw than I recollected him to be one of those young fellows with whom I had been committed to the round-house, during our frolic with Jackson, as I have related before. He received me with a good deal of courtesy, and, when I put him in mind of our former acquaintance, expressed great joy at seeing me again, and recommended me to an exceeding good mess, composed of the gunner and master\u2019s mate. As there was not one sick person in the ship, I got leave to go ashore next day with the gunner, who recommended me to a Jew, that bought my ticket at the rate of forty per cent discount; and, having furnished myself with the necessaries I wanted, returned on board in the evening, and, to my surprise, found my old antagonist Crampley walking upon deck. Though I did not fear his enmity, I was shocked at his appearance, and communicated my sentiments on that subject to Mr. Tomlins the surgeon, who told me that Crampley, by dint of some friends about the admiral, had procured a commission, constituting him lieutenant on board the Lizard; and advised me, now he was my superior officer, to behave with some respect towards him, or else he would find a thousand opportunities of using me ill. This advice was a bitter potion to me, whom pride and resentment had rendered utterly incapable of the least submission to, or even of a reconciliation with, the wretch who had, on many occasions, treated me so inhumanly: however, I resolved to have as little connection as possible with him, and to ingratiate myself as much as I could with the rest of the officers, whose friendship might be a bulwark to defend me from the attempts of his malice.\n\nIn less than a week we sailed on a cruise, and having weathered the east end of the island, had the good fortune to take a Spanish barcolongo, with her prize, which was an English ship bound for Bristol, that sailed from Jamaica a fortnight before, without convoy. All the prisoners who were well, we put onshore on the north side of the island; the prizes were manned with Englishmen, and the command of the barcolongo given to my friend the master\u2019s mate, with orders to carry them into Port Morant, and there to remain until the Lizard\u2019s cruise should be ended, at which time she would touch at the same place in her way to Port Royal. With him I was sent to attend the wounded Spaniards as well as Englishmen, who amounted to sixteen, and to take care of them on shore in a house that was to be hired as an hospital. This destination gave me a great deal of pleasure, as I should, for some time, be freed from the arrogance of Crampley, whose inveteracy against me had already broken out on two or three occasions since he was become a lieutenant. My messmate, who very much resembled my uncle, both in figure and disposition, treated me on board of the prize with the utmost civility and confidence: and, among other favours, made me a present of a silver-hilted hanger, and a pair of pistols mounted with the same metal, which fell to his share in plundering the enemy. We arrived safely at Morant, and, going on shore, pitched upon an empty storehouse; which we hired for the reception of the wounded, who were brought to it next day, with beds and other necessaries; and four of the ship\u2019s company appointed to attend them and obey me.\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nA strange adventure\u2014in consequence of which I am extremely happy\u2014Crampley does me in offices with the Captain; but his malice is defeated by the good-nature and friendship of the surgeon\u2014we return to Port Royal\u2014our Captain gets the command of a larger ship, and is succeeded by an old man\u2014Brayl is provided for\u2014we receive orders to sail for England\n\nWhen my patients were all in a fair way, my companion and commander, whose name was Brayl, carried me up the country to the house of a rich planter, with whom he was acquainted, where we were sumptuously entertained, and in the evening set out on our return to the ship. When we had walked about a mile by moonlight, we perceived a horseman behind us, who coming up, wished us good even, and asked which way we went? His voice, which was quite familiar to me, no sooner struck my ear, than in spite of all my resolution and reflection, my hair bristled up, and I was seized with a violent fit of trembling, which Brayl misinterpreting, bade me be under no concern. I told him he was mistaken in the cause of my disorder; and, addressing myself to the person on horseback said, \u201cI could have sworn by your voice, that you were a dear friend of mine, if I had not been certain of his death.\u201d To this address, after some pause, he replied, \u201cThere are many voices as well as faces that resemble one another; but, pray, what was your friend\u2019s name.\u201d I satisfied him in that particular, and gave a short detail of the melancholy fate of Thompson, not without many sighs and some tears. A silence ensued, which lasted some minutes, and then the conversation turned on different subjects, till we arrived at a house on the road, where the horseman alighted, and begged with so much earnestness that we would go in and drink a bowl of punch with him, that we could not resist. But, if I was alarmed at his voice, what must my amazement be, when I discovered by the light the very person of my lamented friend! Perceiving my confusion, which was extreme, he clasped me in his arms, and bedewed my face with tears. It was some time ere I recovered the use of my reason, overpowered with this event, and longer still before I could speak. So that all I was capable of was to return his embraces, and to mingle the overflowings of my joy with his; whilst honest Brayl, affected with the scene, wept as fast as either of us, and signified his participation of our happiness by hugging us both, and capering about the room like a madman. At length, I retrieved the use of my tongue, and cried, \u201cIs it possible! you can be my friend Thompson? No certainly, alas! he was drowned; and I am now under the deception of a dream!\u201d He was at great pains to convince me of his being the individual person whom I regretted, and bidding me sit down and compose myself, promised to explain his sudden disappearance from the Thunder, and to account for his being at present in the land of the living. This task he acquitted himself of, after I had drunk a glass of punch, and recollected my spirits, by informing us, that with a determination to rid himself of a miserable existence, he had gone in the night-time to the head, while the ship was on her way, from whence he slipped down as softly as he could, by the bows into the sea, where, after he was heartily ducked, he began to repent of his precipitation; and, as he could swim very well, kept himself above water, in hopes of being taken up by some of the ships astern; that, in this situation, he hailed a large vessel, and begged to be taken in, but was answered that she was a heavy sailer, and therefore they did not choose to lose time by bringing to; however, they threw an old chest overboard for his convenience, and told him, that some of the ships astern would certainly save him; that no other vessel came within sight or cry of him for the space of three hours, during which time he had the mortification to find himself in the middle of the ocean alone, without other support or resting-place, but what a few crazy boards afforded; till at last he discerned a small sloop steering towards him, upon which he set up his throat, and had the good fortune to be heard and rescued from the dreary waste by their boat, which was hoisted out on purpose.\n\n\u201cI was no sooner brought on board,\u201d continued he, \u201cthan I fainted, and, when I recovered my senses, found myself in bed, regaled with a most noisome smell of onions and cheese, which made me think at first that I was in my own hammock, alongside of honest Morgan, and that all which had passed was no more than a dream. Upon inquiry, I understood that I was on board of a schooner belonging to Rhode Island, bound for Jamaica, with a cargo of geese, pigs, onions, and cheese, and that the master\u2019s name was Robertson, by birth a North Briton, whom I knew at first sight to be an old school-fellow of mine. When I discovered myself to him, he was transported with surprise and joy, and begged to know the occasion of my misfortune, which I did not think fit to disclose, because I knew his notions with regard to religion were very severe and confined; therefore contented myself with telling him I fell overboard by accident; but made no scruple of explaining the nature of my disagreeable station, and of acquainting him with my determined purpose never to return to the Thunder man-of-war. Although he was not of my opinion in that particular, knowing that I must lose my clothes and what pay was due to me, unless I went back to my duty; yet, when I described the circumstances of the hellish life I led under the tyrannic sway of Oakum and Mackshane; and, among other grievances, hinted a dissatisfaction at the irreligious deportment of my shipmates, and the want of the true presbyterian gospel doctrine; he changed his sentiments, and conjured me with great vehemence and zeal to lay aside all thought of rising in the navy; and, that he might show how much he had my interest at heart, undertook to provide for me in some shape or other, before he should leave Jamaica. This promise he performed to my heart\u2019s desire, by recommending me to a gentleman of fortune, with whom I have lived ever since in quality of surgeon and overseer to his plantations. He and his lady are now at Kingston, so that I am, for the present, master of this house, to which, from my soul, I bid you welcome, and hope you will favour me with your company during the remaining part of the night.\u201d\n\nI needed not a second invitation; but Mr. Brayl, who was a diligent and excellent officer, could not be persuaded to sleep out of the ship; however, he supped with us, and, after having drank a cheerful glass, set out for the vessel, which was not above three miles from the place, escorted by a couple of stout negroes, whom Mr. Thompson ordered to conduct him. Never were two friends more happy in the conversation of each other than we, for the time it lasted. I related to him the particulars of our attempt upon Carthagena, of which he had heard but an imperfect account; and he gratified me with a narration of every little incident of his life since we parted. He assured me, it was with the utmost difficulty he could resist his inclination of coming down to Port Royal, to see Morgan and me, of whom he had heard no tidings since the day of our separation: but that he was restrained by the fear of being detained as a deserter. He told me that, when he heard my voice in the dark, he was almost as much surprised as I was at seeing him afterwards: and, in the confidence of friendship, disclosed a passion he entertained for the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he lived, who, by his description, was a very amiable young lady, and did not disdain his addresses; that he was very much favoured by her parents; and did not despair of obtaining their consent to the match, which would at once render him independent of the world. I congratulated him on his good fortune, which he protested should never make him forget his friends; and, towards morning, we betook ourselves to rest.\n\nNext day he accompanied me to the ship, where Mr. Brayl entertained him at dinner, and we having spent the afternoon together, he took his leave of us in the evening, after he had forced upon me ten pistoles, as a small token of his affection. In short, while he stayed here, we saw one another every day, and generally ate at the same table, which was plentifully supplied by him with all kinds of poultry, butcher\u2019s meat, oranges, limes, lemons, pine-apples, Madeira wine, and excellent rum; so that this small interval of ten days was by far the most agreeable period of my life.\n\nAt length the Lizard arrived; and my patients being all fit for duty, they and I were ordered on board of her, where I understood from Mr. Tomlins that there was a shyness between the lieutenant and him on my account; the rancorous villain having taken the opportunity of my absence to fill the captain\u2019s ears with a thousand scandalous stories to my prejudice; among other things affirming, that I had been once transported for theft, and that when I was in the Thunder man-of-war, I had been whipped for the same crime. The surgeon, on the other hand, having heard my whole story from my own mouth, defended me strenuously, and in the course of that good-natured office recounted all the instances of Crampley\u2019s malice against me while I remained on board of that ship; which declaration, while it satisfied the captain of my innocence, made the lieutenant as much my defender\u2019s enemy as mine. The infernal behaviour of Crampley, with regard to me, added such fuel to his former resentment, that, at certain times, I was quite beside myself with the desire of revenge, and was even tempted to pistol him on the quarter-deck, though an infamous death must inevitably have been my reward. But the surgeon, who was my confidant, argued against such a desperate action so effectually, that I stifled the flame which consumed me for the present, and resolved to wait for a more convenient opportunity. In the meantime, that Mr. Tomlins might be the more convinced of the wrongs I suffered by this fellow\u2019s slander, I begged he would go and visit Mr. Thompson, whose wonderful escape I had made him acquainted with, and inquire of him into the particulars of my conduct, while he was my fellow-mate.\n\nThis request the surgeon complied with, more through curiosity to see a person whose fate had been so extraordinary, than to confirm his good opinion of me, which he assured me was already firmly established. He therefore set out for the dwelling-place of my friend, with a letter of introduction from me; and being received with all the civility and kindness I expected, returned to the ship, not only satisfied with my character beyond the power of doubt or insinuation, but also charmed with the affability and conversation of Thompson, who loaded him and me with presents of fresh stock, liquors, and fruit. As he would not venture to come and see us on board, lest Cramplay should know and detain him; when the time of our departure approached, I obtained leave to go and bid him farewell. After we had vowed an everlasting friendship, he pressed upon me a purse, with four doubloons, which I refused as long as I could without giving umbrage; and, having cordially embraced each other, I returned on board, where I found a small box, with a letter directed for me, to the care of Mr. Tomlins. Knowing the superscription to be of Thompson\u2019s handwriting, I opened it with some surprise, and learned that this generous friend, not content with loading me with the presents already mentioned, had sent, for my use and acceptance, half a dozen fine shirts, and as many linen waistcoats and caps, with twelve pair of new thread stockings. Being thus provided with money and all necessaries for the comfort of life, I began to look upon myself as a gentleman of some consequence, and felt my pride dilate a pace.\n\nNext day we sailed for Port Royal, where we arrived safely with our prizes; and, as there was nothing to do on board, I went ashore, and having purchased a laced waistcoat, with some other clothes, at a sale, made a swaggering figure for some days among the taverns, where I ventured to play a little at hazard, and came off with fifty pistoles in my pocket. Meanwhile our captain was promoted to a ship of twenty guns, and the command of the Lizard given to a man turned of fourscore, who had been lieutenant since the reign of King William, and, notwithstanding his long service, would have probably died in that station, had he not applied some prize-money he had lately received, to make interest with his superiors. My friend Brayl was also made an officer about the same time, after he had served in quality of a midshipman and mate for five and twenty years. Soon after these alterations, the admiral pitched upon our ship to carry home dispatches for the ministry; and we set sail for England, having first scrubbed her bottom, and taken in provision and water for the occasion.\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nWe depart for Europe\u2014a misunderstanding arises between the Captain and the Surgeon, through the scandalous aspersions of Crampley\u2014the Captain dies\u2014Crampley tyrannises over the surgeon, who falls a Victim for his Cruelty\u2014I am also ill-used\u2014the Ship strikes\u2014the behaviour of Crampley and the Seamen on that occasion\u2014-I get on shore, challenge the Captain to single combat\u2014am treacherously knocked down, wounded, and robbed\n\nNow that I could return to my native country in a creditable way, I felt excessive pleasure in finding myself out of sight of that fatal island, which has been the grave of so many Europeans: and, as I was accommodated with everything to make the passage agreeable, I resolved to enjoy myself as much as the insolence of Crampley would permit. This insidious slanderer had found means already to cause a misunderstanding between the surgeon and captain, who, by his age and infirmities, was rendered intolerably peevish, his disposition having also been soured by a long course of disappointments. He had a particular aversion to all young men, especially to surgeons, whom he considered unnecessary animals on board of a ship; and, in consequence of these sentiments, never consulted the doctor, notwithstanding his being seized with a violent fit of the gout and gravel, but applied to a cask of Holland gin, which was his sovereign prescription against all distempers: whether he was at this time too sparing, or took an overdose of his cordial, certain it is, he departed in the night, without any ceremony, which indeed was a thing he always despised, and was found stiff next morning, to the no small satisfaction of Crampley, who succeeded to the command of the vessel. For that very reason, Mr. Tomlins and I had no cause to rejoice at this event, fearing that the tyranny of our new commander would now be as unlimited as his power. The first day of his command justified our apprehensions: for, on pretence that the decks were too much crowded, he ordered the surgeon\u2019s hencoops, with all his fowls, to be thrown overboard; and at the same time prohibited him and me from walking on the quarter-deck.\n\nMr. Tomlins could not help complaining of these injuries, and in the course of his expostulation dropped some hasty words, of which Crampley taking hold, confined him to his cabin, where, in a few days, for want of air he was attacked by a fever, which soon put an end to his life, after he had made his will, by which he bequeathed all his estate, personal and real, to his sister, and left to me his watch and instruments as memorials of his friendship. I was penetrated with grief on this melancholy occasion; the more because there was nobody on board to whom I could communicate my sorrows, or of whom I could receive the least consolation or advice. Crampley was so far from discovering the least remorse for his barbarity, at the news of the surgeon\u2019s death, that he insulted his memory in the most abusive manner, and affirmed he had poisoned himself out of pure fear, dreading to be brought to a court-martial for mutiny; for which reason he would not suffer the service of the dead to be read over his body before it was thrown overboard.\n\nNothing but a speedy deliverance could have supported me under the brutal sway of this bashaw, who, to render my life more irksome, signified to my messmates a desire that I should be expelled from their society. This was no sooner hinted, than they granted his request; and I was fain to eat in a solitary manner by myself during the rest of the passage, which, however, soon drew to a period.\n\nWe had been seven weeks at sea, when the gunner told the captain that, by his reckoning, we must be in soundings, and desired he would order the lead to be heaved. Crampley swore he did not know how to keep the ship\u2019s way, for we were not within a hundred leagues of soundings, and therefore he would not give himself the trouble to cast the lead. Accordingly we continued our course all that afternoon and night, without shortening sail, although the gunner pretended to discover Scilly light; and next morning protested in form against the captain\u2019s conduct, for which he was put in confinement, We discovered no land all that day, and Crampley was still so infatuated as to neglect sounding; but at three o\u2019clock in the morning the ship struck, and remained fast on a sand-bank. This accident alarmed the whole crew; the boat was immediately hoisted out, but as we could not discern which way the shore lay, we were obliged to wait for daylight. In the meantime, the wind increased, and the waves beat against the sloop with such violence, that we expected she would have gone to pieces. The gunner was released and consulted: he advised the captain to cut away the mast, in order to lighten her; this expedient was performed without success: the sailors, seeing things in a desperate situation, according to custom, broke up the chests belonging to the officers, dressed themselves in their clothes, drank their liquors without ceremony, and drunkenness, tumult, and confusion ensued.\n\nIn the midst of this uproar, I went below to secure my own effects, and found the carpenter\u2019s mate hewing down the purser\u2019s cabin with his hatchet, whistling all the while with great composure. When I asked his intention in so doing, he replied, very calmly, \u201cI only want to taste the purser\u2019s rum, that\u2019s all, master.\u201d At that instant the purser coming down, and seeing his effects going to wreck, complained bitterly of the injustice done to him, and asked the fellow what occasion he had for liquor when, in all likelihood, he would be in eternity in a few minutes. \u201cAll\u2019s one for that,\u201d said plunderer, \u201clet us live while we can.\u201d \u201cMiserable wretch that thou art!\u201d cried the purser, \u201cwhat must be thy lot in another world, if thou diest in the commission of robbery?\u201d \u201cWhy, hell, I suppose,\u201d replied the other, with great deliberation, while the purser fell on his knees, and begged of Heaven that we might not all perish for the sake of Jonas.\n\nDuring this dialogue I clothed myself in my bed apparel, girded on my hanger, stuck my pistols, loaded, in my belt, disposed of all my valuable moveables about my person, and came upon deck with a resolution of taking the first opportunity to get on shore, which, when the day broke, appeared at the distance of three miles ahead. Crampley, finding his efforts to get the ship off ineffectual, determined to consult his own safety, by going into the boat, which he had no sooner done, than the ship\u2019s company followed so fast, that she would have sunk alongside, had not some one wiser than the rest cut the rope and put off. But before this happened, I had made several attempts to get in, and was always balked by the captain, who was so eager in excluding me, that he did not mind the endeavours of any other body. Enraged at this inhuman partiality, and seeing the rope cut, I pulled one of my pistols from my belt, and cocking it, swore I would shoot any man who would presume to obstruct my entrance. So saying, I leaped with my full exertion, and got on board of the boat with the loss of the skin of my shins. I chanced in my descent to overturn Crampley, who no sooner got up than he struck at me several times with a cutlass, and ordered the men to throw me overboard; but they were too anxious about their own safety to mind what he said. Though the boat was very deeply loaded, and the sea terribly high, we made shift to get upon dry land in less than an hour after we parted from the sloop. As soon as I set my foot on terra firma, my indignation, which had boiled so long within me, broke out against Crampley, whom I immediately challenged to single combat, presenting my pistols, that he might take his choice: he took one without hesitation, and, before I could cock the other, fired in my face, throwing the pistol after the shot. I felt myself stunned, and imagining the bullet had entered my brain, discharged mine as quick as possible, that I might not die unrevenged: then flying upon my antagonist, knocked out several of his fore-teeth with the butt-end of the piece, and would certainly have made an end of him with that instrument, had he not disengaged himself, and seized his cutlass, which he had given to his servant when he received the pistol. Seeing him armed in this manner, I drew my hanger, and, having flung my pistol at his head, closed with him in a transport of fury, and thrust my weapon into his mouth, which it enlarged on one side to his ear. Whether the smart of this wound disconcerted him, or the unevenness of the ground made him reel, I know not, but he staggered some paces back: I followed close, and with one stroke cut the tendons of the back of his hand, Upon which his cutlass dropped, and he remained defenceless. I know not with what cruelty my rage might have inspired me, if I had not at that instant been felled to the ground by a blow on the back part of my head, which deprived me of all sensation. In this deplorable situation, exposed to the rage of an incensed barbarian, and the rapine of an inhuman crew, I remained for some time; and whether any disputes arose among them during the state of my annihilation, I cannot pretend to determine; but in one particular they seemed to have been unanimous, and acted with equal dexterity and dispatch; for when I recovered the use of my understanding, I found myself alone in a desolate place, stripped of my clothes, money, watch, buckles, and everything but my shoes, stockings, breeches and shirt. What a discovery must this have been to me, who, but an hour before, was worth sixty guineas in cash! I cursed the hour of my birth, the parents that gave me being, the sea that did not swallow me up, the poniard of the enemy, which could not find the way to my heart, the villainy of those who had left me in that miserable condition; and in the ecstacy of despair resolved to be still where I was, and perish.\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nI get up and crawl into a barn, where I am in danger of perishing, through the fear of the country people\u2014their inhumanity\u2014I am succoured by a reputed witch\u2014her story\u2014her advice\u2014she recommends me as a valet to a single lady, whose character she explains\n\nBut as I lay ruminating, my passion insensibly abated; I considered my situation in quite another light, from that in which it appeared to me at first, and the result of my deliberation was to rise if I could, and crawl to the next inhabited place for assistance. With some difficulty I got upon my legs, and having examined my body, found I had received no other injury than two large contused wounds, one on the fore and another on the hinder part of my head, which seemed to be occasioned by the same weapon, namely, the butt-end of a pistol. I looked towards the sea, but could discern no remains of the ship; so that I concluded she was gone to pieces, and that those who remained in her had perished: but, as I afterwards learned, the gunner, who had more sagacity than Crampley, observing that it was flood when he left her, and that she would probably float at high water, made no noise about getting on shore, but continued on deck, in hopes of bringing her safe into some harbour, after her commander should have deserted her, for which piece of service he expected, no doubt, to be handsomely rewarded. This scheme he accordingly executed, and was promised great things by the Admiralty for saving his Majesty\u2019s ship: but I never heard he reaped the fruits of his expectation. As for my own part, I directed my course towards a small cottage I perceived, and in the road picked up a seaman\u2019s old jacket, which I suppose the thief who dressed himself in my clothes had thrown away: this was a very comfortable acquisition to me, who was almost stiff with cold: I therefore put it on; and, as my natural heat revived, my wounds, which had left off bleeding, burst out afresh; so that, finding myself excessively exhausted, I was about to lie down in the fields, when I discovered a barn on my left hand, within a few yards of me; thither I made shift to stagger, and finding the door open, went in, but saw nobody; however, I threw myself upon a truss of straw, hoping to be soon relieved by some person or other. I had not lain here many minutes, when I saw a countryman come in with a pitchfork in his hand, which he was upon the point of thrusting into the straw that concealed me, and in all probability would have done my business, had I not uttered a dreadful groan, after having essayed in vain to speak. This melancholy note alarmed the clown, who started back, and discovering a body all besmeared with blood, stood trembling, with the pitchfork extended before him, his hair bristling up, his eyes staring, his nostrils dilated, and his mouth wide open. At another time I should have been much diverted by this figure, which preserved the same attitude very near ten minutes, during which time I made many unsuccessful efforts to implore his compassion and assistance; but my tongue failed me, and my language was only a repetition of groans. At length an old man arrived, who, seeing the other in such a posture, cried, \u201cMercy upon en! the leaad\u2019s bewitched! why, Dick, beest thou besayd thyself!\u201d Dick, without moving his eyes from the object that terrified him, replied, \u201cO vather! vather! here be either the devil or a dead mon: I doant know which o\u2019en, but a groans woundily.\u201d The father, whose eyesight was none of the best, pulled out his spectacles, and, having applied them to his nose reconnoitered me over his son\u2019s shoulder: but no sooner did he behold me, than he was seized with a fit of shaking, even more violent than Dick\u2019s, and, with a broken accent, addressed me thus: \u201cIn the name of the Vather, Zun, and Holy Ghost, I charge you, an you been Satan, to be gone to the Red Zen; but an you be a moordered mon, speak, that you may have a Christom burial.\u201d\n\nAs I was not in a condition to satisfy him in this particular, he repeated his conjuration to no purpose, and they continued a good while in the agonies of fear. At length the father proposed that the son should draw nearer, and take a more distinct view of the apparition; but Dick was of opinion that his father should advance first, he being an old man past his labour and, if he received any mischief, the loss would be the smaller; whereas he himself might escape, and be useful, in his generation. This prudential reason had no effect upon the senior, who still kept Dick between me and him. In the meantime I endeavoured to raise one hand as a signal of distress, but had only strength sufficient to produce a rustling among the straw, which discomposed the young peasant so much, that he sprang out at the door, and overthrew his father in his flight. The old gentleman would not spend time in getting up, but crawled backwards like a crab, with great speed, till he had got over the threshold, mumbling exorcisms all the way. I was exceedingly mortified to find myself in danger of perishing through the ignorance and cowardice of these clowns; and felt my spirits decay apace, when an old woman entered the barn, followed by the two fugitives and with great intrepidity advanced to the place where I lay, saying, \u201cIf it be the devil I fearen not, and for a dead mon a can do us no harm.\u201d When she saw my condition, she cried, \u201cHere be no devil, but in your en fool\u2019s head. Here be a poor miserable wretch bleeding to death, and if a dies, we must be at the charge of burying him; therefore, Dick, go vetch the old wheelbarrow and put en in, and carry en to goodman Hodge\u2019s backdoor; he is more able than we to pay out money upon poor vagrants.\u201d Her advice was taken, and immediately put in execution; I was rolled to the other farmer\u2019s door, where I was tumbled out like a heap of dung; and should certainly have fallen a prey to the hogs, if my groans had not disturbed the family, and brought some of them out to view my situation. But Hodge resembled the Jew more than the good Samaritan, and ordered me to be carried to the house of the parson, whose business it was to practise as well as to preach charity; observing that it was sufficient for him to pay his quota towards the maintenance of the poor belonging to his own parish. When I was set down at the vicar\u2019s gate, he fell into a mighty passion, and threatened to excommunicate him who sent, as well as those who brought me, unless they would move me immediately to another place. About this time I fainted with the fatigue I had undergone, and afterwards understood that I was bandied from door to door through a whole village, nobody having humanity enough to administer the least relief to me, Until an old woman, who was suspected of witchcraft by the neighbourhood, hearing of my distress, received me into her house, and, having dressed my wounds, brought me to myself with cordials of her own preparing. I was treated with great care and tenderness by this grave matron, who, after I had recovered some strength, desired to know the particulars of my last disaster. This piece of satisfaction I could not refuse to one who had saved my life, therefore related all my adventures without exaggeration or reserve. She seemed surprised at the vicissitudes I had undergone, and drew a happy presage of my future life from my past suffering, then launched out into the praise of adversity, with so much ardour and good sense, that I concluded she was a person who had seen better days, and conceived a longing desire to hear her story. She perceived my drift by some words I dropped, and smiling told me, there was nothing either entertaining or extraordinary in the course of her fortune; but, however, she would communicate it to me, in consideration of the confidence I had reposed in her. \u201cIt is of little consequence,\u201d said she, \u201cto tell the names of my parents, who are dead many years ago; let it suffice to assure you, they were wealthy, and had no other child than me; so that I was looked upon as heiress to a considerable estate, and teased with addresses on that account. Among the number of my admirers, there was a young gentleman of no fortune, whose sole dependence was on his promotion in the army, in which, at that time, he bore a lieutenant\u2019s commission. I conceived an affection for this amiable officer, which, in a short time, increased to a violent passion, and without entering into minute circumstances, married him privately. We had not enjoyed one another long in stolen interviews, when he was ordered with his regiment to Flanders; but, before he set out, it was agreed between us, that we should declare our marriage to my father by letter, and implore his pardon for the step we had taken without his approbation. This discovery was made while I was abroad visiting, and just as I was about to return home, I received a letter from my father, importing that, since I had acted so undutifully and meanly as to marry a beggar, without his privity or consent, to the disgrace of his family as well as the disappointment of his hopes, he renounced me to the miserable fate I had entailed upon myself, and charged me never to set foot within his doors again. This rigid sentence was confirmed by my mother, who, in a postscript, gave me to understand that her sentiments were exactly conformable to those of my father, and that I might save myself the trouble of making any applications, for her resolutions were unalterable. Thunderstruck with my evil fortune I called a coach, and drove to my husband\u2019s lodgings, where I found him waiting the event of his letter. Though he could easily divine by my looks the issue of his declaration, he read with great steadiness the epistle I had received; and with a smile full of tenderness, which I shall never forget, embraced me, saying, \u201cI believe the good lady your mother might have spared herself the trouble of the last part of her postscript. Well, my dear Betty, you must lay aside all thoughts of a coach, till I can procure the command of a regiment.\u201d This unconcerned behaviour, while it enabled me to support my reverse of fortune, at the same time endeared him to me the more, by convincing me of his disinterested views in espousing me. I was next day boarded in company with the wife of another officer, who had long been the friend and confidant of my husband, at a village not far from London, where they parted with us in the most melting manner, went to Flanders, and were killed in sight of one another at the battle of the Wood.\n\n\u201cWhy should I tire you with a description of our unutterable sorrow at the fatal news of this event, the remembrance of which now fills my aged eyes with tears! When our grief subsided a little, and reflection came to our aid, we found ourselves deserted by the whole world, and in danger of perishing by want; whereupon we made application for the pension, and were put upon the list. Then, vowing eternal friendship, sold our jewels and superfluous clothes, retired to this place (which is in the county of Sussex) bought this little house, where we lived many years in a solitary manner, indulging our mutual sorrow, till it pleased Heaven to call away my companion two years ago; since which time I have lingered out an unhappy being, in hopes of a speedy dissolution, when I promise myself the eternal reward of all my cares. In the meantime,\u201d continued she, \u201cI must inform you of the character I bear among my neighbours. My conversation being different from that of the inhabitants of the village, my recluse way of life, my skill in curing distempers, which I acquired from books since I settled here, and lastly, my age having made the common people look upon me as something preternatural, and I am actually, at this hour, believed to be a witch. The parson of the parish, whose acquaintance I have not been at much pains to cultivate, taking umbrage at my supposed disrespect, has contributed not a little towards the confirmation of this opinion, by dropping certain hints to my prejudice among the vulgar, who are also very much scandalised at my entertaining this poor tabby cat with the collar about her neck, which was a favourite of my deceased companion.\u201d\n\nThe whole behaviour of this venerable person was so primitive, innocent, sensible, and humane, that I contracted a filial respect for her, and begged her advice with regard to my future conduct, as soon as I was in a condition to act for myself. She dissuaded me from a design I had formed of travelling to Louder, in hopes of retrieving my clothes and pay, by returning to my ship, which by this time I read in the newspaper was safely arrived in the River Thames: \u201cbecause,\u201d said she, \u201cyou run the hazard of being treated not only as a deserter in quitting the sloop, but also as a mutineer, in assaulting your commanding officer, to the malice of whose revenge you will moreover be exposed.\u201d She then promised to recommend me, as servant to a single lady of her acquaintance, who lived in the neighbourhood with her nephew, who was a young foxhunter of great fortune, where I might be very happy, provided I could bear with the disposition and manners of my mistress, which were somewhat whimsical and particular. But, above all things, she counselled me to conceal my story, the knowledge of which would effectually poison my entertainment; for it was a maxim, among most people of condition, that no gentleman ought to be admitted into a family as a domestic, lest he become lazy, and insolent. I was fain to embrace this humble proposal, because my affairs were desperate; and in a few days was hired by this lady, to serve in quality of her footman, having been represented by my hostess as a young man who was bred up to the sea by his relations against his will, and had suffered shipwreck, which had increased his disgust to that way of life so much, that he rather chose to go to service on shore, than enter himself on board of any other ship. Before I took possession of my new place, she gave me a sketch of my mistress\u2019s character, that I might know better how to regulate my conduct.\n\n\u201cYour lady,\u201d said she, \u201cis a maiden of forty years, not so remarkable for her beauty as her learning and taste, which is famous all over the country. Indeed, she is a perfect female virtuoso, and so eager after the pursuit of knowledge that she neglects her person even to a degree of sluttishness; this negligence, together with her contempt of the male part of the creation, gives her nephew no great concern, as by these means he will probably keep her fortune, which is considerable in the family. He therefore permits her to live in her own way, which is something extraordinary, and gratifies her in all her whimsical desires. Her apartment is at some distance from the other inhabited parts of the house; and consists of a dining-room, bedchamber, and study; she keeps a cook maid, a waiting-woman, and footman, of her own, and seldom eats or converses with any of the family but her niece, who is a very lovely creature, and humours her aunt often to the prejudice of her own health by sitting up with her whole nights together; for your mistress is too much of a philosopher to be swayed by the custom of the world, and never sleeps nor eats like other people. Among other odd notions, she professes the principles of Rosicrucius, and believes the earth, air, and sea, are inhabited by invisible beings, with whom it is possible for the human species to entertain correspondence and intimacy, on the easy condition of living chaste. As she hopes one day to be admitted into an acquaintance of this kind, she no sooner heard of me and my cat, than she paid me a visit, with a view, as she has since owned, to be introduced to my familiar; and was greatly mortified to find herself disappointed in her expectation. Being by this visionary turn of mind abstracted as it were from the world, she cannot advert to the common occurrences of life; and therefore is frequently so absent as to commit very strange mistakes and extravagancies, which you will do well to rectify and repair, as your prudence shall suggest.\u201d\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nMy Reception by that Lady\u2014I become enamoured of Narcissa\u2014recount the particulars of my last misfortune\u2014acquire the good opinion of my Mistress\u2014an Account of the young Squire\u2014I am made acquainted with more particulars of Narcissa\u2019s Situation\u2014conceive a mortal hatred against Sir Timothy\u2014examine my Lady\u2019s library and performances\u2014her extravagant behaviour\n\nFraught with these useful instructions, I repaired to the place of her habitation, and was introduced by the waiting-woman to the presence of my lady, who had not before seen me. She sat in her study, with one foot on the ground, and the other upon a high stool at some distance from her seat; her sandy locks hung down, in a disorder I cannot call beautiful, from her head, which was deprived of its coif, for the benefit of scratching with one hand, while she held the stump of a pen in the other. Her forehead was high and wrinkled; her eyes were large, gray, and prominent; her nose was long, and aquiline: her mouth of vast capacity, her visage meagre and freckled, and her chin peaked like a shoemaker\u2019s paring knife; her upper lip contained a large quantity of plain Spanish, which, by continual falling, had embroidered her neck, that was not naturally very white, and the breast of her gown, that flowed loose about her with a negligence that was truly poetic, discovering linen that was very fine, and, to all appearance, never washed but in Castalian streams. Around her lay heaps of books, globes, quadrants, telescopes, and other learned apparatus; her snuff-box stood at her right hand: at her left hand lay her handkerchief, sufficiently used, and a convenience to spit in appeared on one side of her chair. She being in a reverie when we entered, the maid did not think proper to disturb her; so that we waited some minutes unobserved, during which time she bit the quill several times, altered her position, made many wry faces, and, at length, with an air of triumph, repeated aloud:\n\n\u201cNor dare th\u2019immortal gods my rage oppose!\u201d\n\nHaving committed her success to paper, she turned towards the door, and perceiving us, cried, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s the young man,\u201d replied my conductress, \u201cwhom Mrs. Sagely recommended as a footman to your ladyship.\u201d On this information she stared in my face for a considerable time, and then asked my name, which I thought proper to conceal under that of John Brown. After having surveyed me with a curious eye, she broke out into, \u201cO! ay, thou wast shipwrecked, I remember. Whether didst thou come on shore on the back of a whale or a dolphin?\u201d To this I answered, I had swam ashore without any assistance. Then she demanded to know if I had ever been at the Hellespont, and swam from Sestos to Abydos. I replied in the negative; upon which she bade the maid order a suit of new livery for me, and instruct me in the articles of my duty: so she spit in her snuff-box, and wiped her nose with her cap, which lay on the table, instead of a handkerchief.\n\nWe returned to the kitchen, where I was regaled by the maids, who seemed to vie with each other in expressing their regard for me; and from them I understood, that my business consisted in cleaning knives and forks, laying the cloth, waiting at table, carrying messages, and attending my lady when she went abroad. There was a very good suit of livery in the house, which had belonged to my predecessor deceased, and it fitted me exactly; so that there was no occasion for employing a tailor on my account. I had not been long equipped in this manner, when my lady\u2019s bell rung; upon which, I ran up stairs, and found her stalking about the room in her shift and under petticoat only; I would immediately have retired as became me, but she bade me come in, and air a clean shift for her; which operation I having performed with some backwardness, she put it on before me without any ceremony, and I verily believe was ignorant of my sex all that time, as being quite absorbed in contemplation. About four o\u2019clock in the afternoon I was ordered to lay the cloth, and place two covers, which I understood were for my mistress and her niece, whom I had not as yet seen. Though I was not very dexterous at this work, I performed it pretty well for a beginner, and, when dinner was upon the table, saw my mistress approach, accompanied by the young lady, whose name for the present shall be Narcissa. So much sweetness appeared in the countenance and carriage of this amiable apparition, that my heart was captivated at first sight, and while dinner lasted, I gazed upon her without intermission. Her age seemed to be seventeen, her stature tall, her shape unexceptionable, her hair, that fell down upon her ivory neck in ringlets, black as jet; her arched eyebrows of the same colour; her eyes piercing, yet tender; her lips of the consistence and hue of cherries; her complexion clear, delicate and healthy; her aspect noble, ingenuous, and humane; and the whole person so ravishingly delightful, that it was impossible for any creature endued with sensibility, to see without admiring, and admire without loving her to excess. I began to curse the servile station that placed me so far beneath the regard of this idol of my adoration! and yet I blessed my fate, that enabled me to enjoy daily the sight of so much perfection! When she spoke I listened with pleasure; but when she spoke to me, my soul was thrilled with an extacy of tumultuous joy. I was even so happy as to be the subject of their conversation; for Narcissa, having observed me, said to her aunt, \u201cI see your new footman is come.\u201d Then addressing herself to me, asked, with ineffable complacency, if I was the person who had been so cruelly used by robbers? When I had satisfied her in this; she expressed a desire of knowing the other particulars of my fortune, both before and since my being shipwrecked: hereupon (as Mrs. Sagely had counselled me) I told her that I had been bound apprentice to the master of a ship, contrary to my inclination, which ship had foundered at sea; that I and four more, who chanced to be on deck when she went down, made shift to swim to the shore, when my companions, after having overpowered me, stripped me to the shirt, and left me, as they imagined, dead of the wounds I received in my own defence. Then I related the circumstances of being found in a barn, with the inhuman treatment I met with from the country people and parson; the description of which, I perceived, drew tears from the charming creature\u2019s eyes. When I had finished my recital, my mistress, said, \u201cMa foi! le gar\xe7on est bien fait!\u201d To which opinion Narcissa assented, with a compliment to my understanding, in the same language, that flattered my vanity extremely.\n\nThe conversation, among other subjects, turned upon the young squire, whom my lady inquired after under the title of the Savage; and was informed by her niece that he was still in bed, repairing the fatigue of last night\u2019s debauch, and recruiting strength and spirits to undergo a fox chase to-morrow morning, in company with Sir Timothy Thicket, Squire Bumper, and a great many other gentlemen of the same stamp, whom he had invited on that occasion! so that by daybreak the whole house would be in an uproar. This was a very disagreeable piece of news to the virtuoso, who protested she would stuff her ears with cotton when she went to bed, and take a dose of opium to make her sleep the more sound, that she might not be disturbed and distracted by the clamour of the brutes.\n\nWhen their dinner was over, I and my fellow servants sat down to ours in the kitchen, where I understood that Sir Timothy Thicket was a wealthy knight in the neighbourhood, between whom and Narcissa a match had been projected by her brother, who promised at the same time to espouse Sir Timothy\u2019s sister; by which means, as their fortunes were pretty equal, the young ladies would be provided for, and their brothers be never the poorer; but that the ladies did not concur in the scheme, each of them entertaining a hearty contempt for the person allotted to her for a husband by this agreement. This information begat in me a mortal aversion to Sir Timothy, whom I looked upon as my rival, and cursed in my heart for his presumption.\n\nNext morning, by daybreak, being awakened by the noise of the hunters and hounds, I rose to view the cavalcade, and had a sight of my competitor, whose accomplishments (the estate excluded) did not seem brilliant enough to give me much uneasiness with respect to Narcissa, who, I flattered myself, was not to be won by such qualifications as he was master of, either as to person or mind. My mistress, notwithstanding her precaution, was so much disturbed by her nephew\u2019s company, that she did not rise till five o\u2019clock in the afternoon; so that I had an opportunity of examining her study at leisure, to which examination I was strongly prompted by my curiosity. Here I found a thousand scraps of her own poetry, consisting of three, four, ten, twelve, and twenty lines, on an infinity of subjects, which, as whim inspired, she had begun, without constancy or capacity to bring to any degree of composition: but, what was very extraordinary in a female poet, there was not the least mention made of love in any of her performances. I counted fragments of five tragedies, the titles of which were \u201cThe Stern Philosopher,\u201d \u201cThe Double,\u201d \u201cThe Sacrilegious Traitor,\u201d \u201cThe Fall of Lucifer,\u201d and \u201cThe Last Day.\u201d From whence I gathered, that her disposition was gloomy, and her imagination delighted with objects of horror. Her library was composed of the best English historians, poets, and philosophers; of all the French critics and poets, and of a few books in Italian, chiefly poetry, at the head of which were Tasso and Ariosto, pretty much used. Besides these, translations of the classics into French, but not one book in Greek or Latin; a circumstance that discovered her ignorance in these languages.\n\nAfter having taken a full view of this collection, I retired, and at the usual time was preparing to lay the cloth, when I was told by the maid that her mistress was still in bed, and had been so affected with the notes of the hounds in the morning, that she actually believed herself a hare beset by the hunters, and begged a few greens to munch for breakfast. When I expressed my surprise in this unaccountable imagination she gave me to understand that her lady was very much subject to whims of this nature; sometimes fancying herself an animal, sometimes a piece of furniture, during which conceited transformations it was very dangerous to come near her, especially when she represented a beast; for that lately, in the character of a cat, she had flown at her, and scratched her face in a terrible manner: that some months ago, she prophesied the general conflagration was at hand, and nothing would be able to quench it but her water, which therefore she kept so long, that her life was in danger, and she must needs have died of the retention, had they not found an expedient to make her evacuate, by kindling a bonfire under her chamber window and persuading her that the house was in flames: upon which, with great deliberation, she bade them bring all the tubs and vessels they could find to be filled for the preservation of the house, into one of which she immediately discharged the cause of her distemper. I was also informed that nothing contributed so much to the recovery of her reason as music, which was always administered on those occasions by Narcissa, who played perfectly well on the harpsichord, and to whom she (the maid) was just then going to intimate her aunt\u2019s disorder.\n\nShe was no sooner gone than I was summoned by the bell to my lady\u2019s chamber, where I found her sitting squat on her hands on the floor, in the manner of puss when she listens to the outcries of her pursuers. When I appeared, she started up with an alarmed look, and sprang to the other side of the room to avoid me, whom, without doubt, she mistook for a beagle thirsting after her life. Perceiving her extreme confusion, I retired, and on the staircase met the adorable Narcissa coming up, to whom I imparted the situation of my mistress; she said not a word, but smiling with unspeakable grace, went into her aunt\u2019s apartment, and in a little time my ears were ravished with the efforts of her skill. She accompanied the instrument with a voice so sweet and melodious, that I did not wonder at the surprising change it produced on the spirits of my mistress which composed to peace and sober reflection.\n\nAbout seven o\u2019clock, the hunters arrived with the skins of two foxes and one badger, carried before them as trophies of their success; and when they were about to sit down to dinner (or supper) Sir Timothy Thicket desired that Narcissa would honour the table with her presence; but this request, notwithstanding her brother\u2019s threats and entreaties, she refused, on pretence of attending her aunt, who was indisposed; so I enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing my rival mortified: but this disappointment made no great impression on him, who consoled himself with the bottle, of which the whole company became so enamoured that, after a most horrid uproar of laughing, singing, swearing, and fighting, they were all carried to bed in a state of utter oblivion. My duty being altogether detached from the squire and his family, I led a pretty easy and comfortable life, drinking daily intoxicating draughts of love from the charms of Narcissa, which brightened on my contemplation every day more and more. Inglorious as my station was, I became blind to my own unworthiness, and even conceived hopes of one day enjoying this amiable creature, whose, affability greatly encouraged these presumptuous thoughts.\nCHAPTER XL\n\nMy mistress is surprised at my learning\u2014communicates her performances to me\u2014I impart some of mine to her\u2014am mortified at her faint praise\u2014Narcissa approves of my conduct\u2014I gain an involuntary conquest over the cookwench and dairymaid\u2014their mutual resentment and insinuations\u2014the jealousy of their lovers\n\nDuring this season of love and tranquillity, my muse, which had lain dormant so long, awoke, and produced several small performances on the subject of my flame. But as it concerned me nearly to remain undiscovered in my character and sentiments, I was under a necessity of mortifying my desire of praise, by confining my works to my own perusal and applause. In the meantime I strove to insinuate myself into the good opinion of both ladies; and succeeded so well, by my diligence and dutiful behaviour, that in a little time I was at least a favourite servant; and frequently enjoyed the satisfaction of hearing myself mentioned in French and Italian, with some degree of warmth and surprise by the dear object of all my wishes, as a person who had so much of the gentleman in my appearance and discourse, that she could not for her soul treat me like a common lacquey. My prudence and modesty were not long proof against these bewitching compliments. One day, while I waited at dinner, the conversation turned upon a knotty passage of Tasso\u2019s Gierusalem, which, it seems, had puzzled them both: after a great many unsatisfactory conjectures, my mistress, taking the book out of her pocket, turned up the place in question, and read the sentence over and over without success; at length, despairing of finding the author\u2019s meaning, she turned to me, saying, \u201cCome hither, Bruno; let us see what fortune will do for us: I will interpret to thee what goes before, and what follows this obscure paragraph, the particular words of which I will also explain, that thou mayst, by comparing one with another, guess the sense of that which perplexes us.\u201d I was too vain to let slip this opportunity of displaying my talents; therefore, without hesitation, read and explained the whole of that which had disconcerted them, to the utter astonishment of both. Narcissa\u2019s face and lovely neck were overspread with blushes, from which I drew a favourable opinion, while her aunt, after having stared at me a good while with a look of amazement, exclaimed, \u201cIn the name of heaven who art thou?\u201d I told her I had picked up a smattering of Italian, during a voyage up the Straits. At this explanation she shook her head, and observed that no smatterer could read as I had done. She then desired to know if I understood French. To which question I answered in the affirmative. She asked if I was acquainted with the Latin and Greek? I replied, \u201cA little.\u201d \u201cOho!\u201d continued she, \u201cand with philosophy and mathematics, I suppose?\u201d I owned I knew something of each. Then she repeated her stare and interrogation. I began to repent of my vanity, and in order to repair the fault I committed, said, it was not to be wondered at if I had a tolerable education, for learning was so cheap in my country, that every peasant was a scholar; but, I hoped her Ladyship would think my understanding no exception to my character. \u201cNo, no, God forbid.\u201d But during the rest of the time they sat at table, they behaved with remarkable reserve.\n\nThis alteration gave me great uneasiness; and I passed the night without sleep, in melancholy reflections on the vanity of young men, which prompts them to commit so many foolish actions, contrary to their own sober judgment. Next day, however, instead of profiting by this self-condemnation, I yielded still more to the dictates of the principle I had endeavoured to chastise, and if fortune had not befriended me more than prudence could expect, I should have been treated with the contempt it deserved. After breakfast my lady, who was a true author, bade me follow her into the study, where she expressed herself thus: \u201cSince you are so learned, you cannot be void of taste; therefore I am to desire your opinion of a small performance in poetry, which I lately composed. You must know that I have planned a tragedy, the subject of which shall be, the murder of a prince before the altar, where he is busy at his devotions. After the deed is perpetrated, the regicide will harangue the people with the bloody dagger in his hand; and I have already composed a speech, which, I think, will suit the character extremely. Here it is.\u201d Then, taking up a scrap of paper, she read, with violent emphasis and gesture, as follows:\u2014\n\n\u201cThus have I sent the simple King to hell,\nWithout or coffin, shroud, or passing bell:\nTo me what are divine and human laws?\nI court no sanction but my own applause!\nRapes, robberies, treasons, yield my soul delight,\nAnd human carnage gratifies my sight:\nI drag the parent by the hoary hair,\nAnd toss the sprawling infant on the spear,\nWhile the fond mother\u2019s cries regale my ear.\nI fight, I vanquish, murder friends and foes;\nNor dare the immortal gods my rage oppose.\u201d\n\nThough I did great violence to my understanding in praising this unnatural rhapsody, I nevertheless extolled it as a production that of itself deserved immortal fame; and besought her ladyship to bless the world with the fruits of those uncommon talents Heaven had bestowed upon her. She smiled with a look of self-complacency, and encouraged by the incense I had offered, communicated all her poetical works which I applauded, one by one, with as little candour as I had shown at first. Satiated with my flattery, which I hope my situation justified, she could not in conscience refuse me an opportunity of shining in my turn: and, therefore, after a compliment to my nice discernment and taste, observed, that doubtless I must have produced something in that way myself, which she desired to see. This was temptation I could by no means resist. I owned that while I was at college I wrote some detached pieces, at the desire of a friend who was in love; and at her request repeated the following verses, which indeed my love for Narcissa had inspired:\u2014\n\nOn Celia,\n\nPlaying on the harpsichord and singing.\n\nWhen Sappho struck the quivering wire,\nThe throbbing breast was all on fire:\nAnd when she raised the vocal lay,\nThe captive soul was charm\u2019d away.\n\nBut had the nymph possessed with these\nThy softer, chaster, power to please;\nThy beauteous air of sprightly youth,\nThy native smiles of artless truth;\n\nThe worm of grief had never preyed\nOn the forsaken love-sick maid:\nNor had she mourn\u2019d a hapless flame,\nNor dash\u2019d on rocks her tender frame.\n\nMy mistress paid me a cold compliment on the versification, which, she said, was elegant enough, but, the subject beneath the pen of a true poet. I was extremely nettled at her indifference, and looked at Narcissa, who by this time had joined us, for her approbation; but she declined giving her opinion, protesting she was no judge of these matters; so that I was forced to retire very much balked in my expectation, which was generally a little too sanguine. In the afternoon, however, the waiting-maid assured me that Narcissa had expressed her approbation of my performance with great warmth, and desired her to procure a copy of it as for herself, that she (Narcissa) might have an opportunity to peruse it at pleasure. I was elated to an extravagant pitch at this intelligence, and immediately transcribed a fair copy of my Ode, which was carried to the dear charmer, together with another on the same subject, as follows:\u2014\n\nThy fatal shaft unerring move;\nI bow before thine altar, Love!\nI feel thou soft resistless flame\nGlide swift through all my vital frame!\n\nFor while I gaze my bosom glows,\nMy blood in tides impetuous flows;\nHope, fear, and joy alternate roll,\nAnd floods of transports \u2019whelm my soul!\n\nMy faltering tongue attempts in vain\nIn soothing murmurs to complain;\nMy tongue some secret magic ties,\nMy murmurs sink in broken sighs.\n\nCondemn\u2019d to nurse eternal care,\nAnd ever drop the silent tear,\nUnheard I mourn, unknown I sigh,\nUnfriended live, unpitied die!\n\nWhether or not Narcissa discovered my passion, I could not learn from her behaviour, which, though always benevolent to me was henceforth more reserved and less cheerful. While my thoughts aspired to a sphere so far above me, I had unwittingly made a conquest of the cookwench and dairymaid, who became so jealous of each other that, if their sentiments had been refined by education, it is probable one or other of them would have had recourse to poison or steel to be avenged of her rival; but, as their minds were happily adapted to their humble station, their mutual enmity was confined to scolding and fistcuffs, in which exercise they were both well skilled. My good fortune did not long remain a secret; for it was disclosed by the frequent broils of these heroines, who kept no decorum in their encounters. The coachman and gardener, who paid their devoirs to my admirers, each to his respective choice, alarmed at my success, laid their heads together, in order to concert a plan of revenge; and the former, having been educated at the academy at Tottenham Court, undertook to challenge me to single combat. He accordingly, with many opprobrious invectives, bade me defiance, and offered to box me for twenty guineas. I told him that, although I believed myself a match for him even at that work I would not descend so far below the dignity of a gentleman as to fight like a porter; but if he had anything to say to me, I was his man at blunderbuss, musket, pistol, sword, hatchet, spit, cleaver, fork, or needle; nay, I swore, that should he give his tongue any more saucy liberties at my expense, I would crop his ears without any ceremony. This rhodomontade, delivered with a stern countenance and resolute tone, had the desired effect upon my antagonist, who, with some confusion, sneaked off, and gave his friend an account of his reception.\n\nThe story, taking air among the servants, procured for me the title of Gentleman John, with which I was sometimes honoured, even by my mistress and Narcissa, who had been informed of the whole affair by the chambermaid. In the meantime, the rival queens expressed their passion by all the ways in their power: the cook entertained me with choice bits, the dairymaid with strokings: the first would often encourage me to declare myself, by complimenting me upon my courage and learning, and observing, that if she had a husband like me, to maintain order and keep accounts, she could make a great deal of money, by setting up an eating-house in London for gentlemen\u2019s servants on board wages. The other courted my affection by showing her own importance, and telling me that many a substantial farmer in the neighbourhood would be glad to marry her, but she was resolved to please her eye, if she should plague her heart. Then she would launch out into the praise of my proper person, and say, she was sure I would make a good husband, for I was very good-natured. I began to be uneasy at the importunities of these inamoratas, whom, at another time perhaps, I might have pleased without the disagreeable sauce of matrimony, but, at present, my whole soul was engrossed by Narcissa; and I could not bear the thoughts of doing anything derogatory to the passion I entertained for her.\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nNarcissa being in danger from the brutality of Sir Timothy, is rescued by me, who revenge myself on my rival\u2014I declare my passion, and retreat to the seaside\u2014am surrounded by smugglers, and carried to Boulogne\u2014find my Uncle Lieutenant Bowling in great distress, and relieve him\u2014our conversation\n\nAt certain intervals my ambition would revive; I would despise myself for my tame resignation to my sordid fate, and revolve a hundred schemes for assuming the character of a gentleman, to which I thought myself entitled by birth and education. In these fruitless suggestions time stole away unperceived, and I had already remained eight months in the station of a footman, when an accident happened that put an end to my servitude, and, for the present, banished all hopes of succeeding in my love.\n\nNarcissa went one day to visit Miss Thicket, who lived with her brother within less than a mile of our house, and was persuaded to walk home in the cool of the evening, accompanied by Sir Timothy, who, having a good deal of the brute in him, was instigated to use some unbecoming familiarities with her, encouraged by the solitariness of a field through which they passed. The lovely creature was incensed at his rude behaviour for which she reproached him in such a manner that he lost all regard to decency, and actually offered violence to this pattern of innocence and beauty. But Heaven would not suffer so much goodness to be violated, and sent me, who, passing by accident near the place, was alarmed with her cries, for her succour. What were the emotions of my soul, when I beheld Narcissa almost sinking beneath the brutal force of this satyr! I flew like lightning to her rescue, and he, perceiving me, quitted his prey, and drew his hanger to chastise my presumption. My indignation was too high to admit one thought of fear, so that, rushing upon him, I struck his weapon out of his hand, and used my cudgel so successfully that he fell to the ground, and lay, to all appearance, without sense. Then I turned to Narcissa, who had swooned, and sitting down by her, gently raised her head, and supported it on my bosom, while, with my hand around her waist, I kept her in that position. My soul was thrilled with tumultuous joy, at feeling the object of my dearest wishes within my arms; and, while she lay insensible, I could not refrain from applying my cheeks to hers, and ravishing a kiss. In a little time the blood began to revisit her face, she opened her enchanting eyes, and, having recollected her late situation, said, with a look full of tender acknowledgment, \u201cDear John, I am eternally obliged to you!\u201d So saying she made an effort to rise, in which I assisted her, and she proceeded to the house, leaning upon me all the way. I was a thousand times tempted by this opportunity to declare my passion, but the dread of disobliging her restrained my tongue. We had not moved a hundred paces from the scene of her distress, when I perceived Sir Timothy rise and walk homeward\u2014a circumstance which, though it gave me some satisfaction, inasmuch as I thereby knew I had not killed him, filled me with just apprehension of his resentment, which I found myself in no condition to withstand; especially when I considered his intimacy with our squire, to whom I knew he could justify himself for what he had done, by imputing it to his love, and desiring his brother Bruin to take the same liberty with his sister, without any fear of offence.\n\nWhen we arrived at the house, Narcissa assured me she would exert all her influence in protecting me from the revenge of Thicket, and likewise engage her aunt in my favour. At the same time, pulling out her purse, offered it as a small consideration for the service I had done her. But I stood too much upon the punctilios of love to incur the least suspicion of being mercenary, and refused the present, by saying I had merited nothing by barely doing my duty. She seemed astonished at my disinterestedness, and blushed: I felt the same suffusion, and, with a downcast eye and broken accent, told her I had one request to make, which, if her generosity would grant, I should think myself fully recompensed, for an age of misery. She changed colour at this preamble, and, with great confusion, replied, she hoped my good sense would hinder me from asking anything she was bound in honour to refuse, and therefore bade me signify my desire. Upon which I kneeled, and engaged to kiss her hand. She immediately, with an averted look, stretched it out: I imprinted on it an ardent kiss, and, bathing it with my tears, cried, \u201cDear Madam, I am an unfortunate gentleman, and love you to distraction, but would have died a thousand deaths rather than make this declaration under such a servile appearance, were I not determined to yield to the rigour of my fate, to fly from your bewitching presence, and bury my presumptuous passion in eternal silence.\u201d With these words I rose, and went away before she could recover her spirits so far as to make any reply.\n\nMy first care was to go and consult Mrs. Sagely, with whom I had entertained a friendly correspondence ever since I left her house. When she understood my situation, the good woman, with real concern, condoled with me on my unhappy fate, and approved of my resolution to leave the country, as being perfectly well acquainted with the barbarous disposition of my rival, \u201cwho, by this time,\u201d said she, \u201chas no doubt meditated a scheme of revenge. Indeed, I cannot see how you will be able to elude his vengeance; being himself in the commission, he will immediately grant warrants for apprehending you; and, as almost all the people in this country are dependent on him or his friend, it will be impossible for you to find shelter among them. If you should be apprehended, he will commit you to jail, where you may possibly in great misery languish till the next assizes, and then be transported for assaulting a magistrate.\u201d\n\nWhile she thus warned me of my danger, we heard a knocking at the door, which threw us both into great consternation, as in all probability, it was occasioned by my pursuers; whereupon this generous old lady, putting two guineas into my hand, with tears in her eyes, bade me, for God\u2019s sake, get out at the back-door and consult my safety as Providence should direct me. There was no time for deliberation. I followed her advice, and escaped by the benefit of a dark night to the seaside, where, while I ruminated on my next excursion, I was all of a sudden surrounded by armed men, who, having bound my hands and feet, bade me make no noise on pain of being shot, and carried me on board of a vessel, which I soon perceived to be a smuggling cutter. This discovery gave me some satisfaction at first, because I concluded myself safe from the resentment of Sir Timothy; but, when I found myself in the hands of ruffians, who threatened to execute me for a spy, I would have thought myself happily quit for a year\u2019s imprisonment, or even transportation. It was in vain for me to protest my innocence: I could not persuade them that I had taken a solitary walk to their haunt, at such an hour, merely for my own amusement; and I did not think it my interest to disclose the true cause of my retreat, because I was afraid they would have made their peace with justice by surrendering me to the penalty of the law. What confirmed their suspicion was, the appearance of a custom-house yacht, which gave them chase, and had well nigh made a prize of their vessel; when they were delivered from their fears by a thick fog, which effectually screened them, and favoured their arrival at Boulogne. But, before they got out of sight of their pursuer, they held a council of war about me, and some of the most ferocious among them would have thrown me overboard as a traitor who had betrayed them to their enemies; but others, more considerate, alleged, that if they put me to death, and should afterwards be taken, they could expect no mercy from the legislature, which would never pardon outlawry aggravated by murder. It was therefore determined by a plurality of votes, that I should be set on shore in France, and left to find my way back to England, as I should think proper, this being punishment sufficient for the bare suspicion of a crime in itself not capital.\n\nAlthough this favourable determination gave me great pleasure, the apprehension of being robbed would not suffer me to be perfectly at ease. To prevent this calamity, as soon as I was untied, in consequence of the aforesaid decision, I tore a small hole in one of my stockings, into which I dropped six guineas, reserving half a piece and some silver in my pocket, that, finding something, they might not be tempted to make any further inquiry. This was a very necessary precaution, for, when we came within sight of the French shore, one of the smugglers told me, I must pay for my passage. To this declaration I replied, that my passage was none of my own seeking; therefore they could not expect a reward from me for transporting me into a strange country by force. \u201cD\u2014me!\u201d said the outlaw, \u201cnone of your palaver; but let me see what money you have got.\u201d So saying, he thrust his hand into my pocket without any ceremony, and emptied it of the contents; then, casting an eye at my hat and wig, which captivated his fancy, he took them off, clapping his own on my head, declared, that a fair exchange was no robbery. I was fain to put up with this bargain, which was by no means favourable to me; and a little while after we went all on shore together.\n\nI resolved to take my leave of those desperadoes without much ceremony, when one of them cautioned me against appearing to their prejudice if ever I returned to England, unless I had a mind to be murdered; for which service, he assured me, the gang never wanted agents. I promised to observe his advice, and departed for the Upper Town, where I inquired for a cabaret, or public-house, into which I went, with an intention of taking some refreshment. In the kitchen, five Dutch sailors sat at breakfast with a large loaf, a firkin of butter, and a keg of brandy, the bung of which they often applied to their mouths with great perseverance and satisfaction. At some distance from them I perceived another person in the same garb, sitting in a pensive solitary manner, entertaining himself with a whiff of tobacco, from the stump of a pipe as black as jet. The appearance of distress never failed to attract my regard and compassion. I approached this forlorn tar with a view to offer him my assistance, and, notwithstanding the alteration of dress and disguise of a long beard, I discovered in him my long lost and lamented uncle and benefactor, Lieutenant Bowling! Good Heaven! what were the agitations of my soul, between the joy of finding again such a valuable friend, and the sorrow of seeing him in such a low condition! The tears gushed down my cheeks; I stood motionless and silent for some time. At length, recovering the use of speech, I exclaimed, \u201cGracious God! Mr. Bowling!\u201d My uncle no sooner heard his name mentioned, than he started up, crying, with some surprise, \u201cHolla!\u201d and, after having looked at me steadfastly, without being able to recollect me, said, \u201cDid you call me, brother,\u201d I told him I had something extraordinary to communicate, and desired him to give me the hearing for a few minutes in another room; but he would by no means consent to this proposal, saying, \u201cAvast there, friend: none of your tricks upon travellers;\u2014if you have anything to say to me, do it above board;\u2014you need not be afraid of being overheard;\u2014here are none who understand our lingo.\u201d Though I was loth to discover myself before company, I could no longer refrain from telling him I was his own nephew, Roderick Random. On this information, he considered me with great earnestness and astonishment, and, recalling my features, which, though enlarged, were not entirely altered since he had seen me, came up, and shook me by the hand very cordially, protesting he was glad to see me well. After some pause, he went on thus; \u201cAnd yet, my lad, I am sorry to see you under such colours; the more so, as it is not in my power, at present, to change them for the better, times being very hard with me,\u201d With these words I could perceive a tear trickle down his furrowed cheek, which affected me so much that I wept bitterly.\n\nImagining my sorrow was the effect of my own misfortunes, he comforted me with observing, that life was a voyage in which we must expect to meet with all weathers; sometimes was calm, sometimes rough; that a fair gale often succeeded a storm; that the wind did not always sit one way, and that despair signified nothing; that resolution and skill were better than a stout vessel: for why? because they require no carpenter, and grow stronger the more labour they undergo. I dried up my tears, which I assured him were not shed for my own distress, but for his, and begged leave to accompany him into another room, where we could converse more at our ease. There I recounted to him the ungenerous usage I had met with from Potion; at which relation he started up, stalked across the room three or four times in a great hurry, and, grasping his cudgel, cried, \u201cI would I were alongside of him\u2014that\u2019s all\u2014I would I were alongside of him!\u201d I then gave him a detail of my adventures and sufferings, which affected him more than I could have imagined; and concluded with telling him that Captain Oakun was still alive, and that he might return to England when he would to solicit his affairs, without danger or molestation. He was wonderfully pleased with this piece of information, of which, however, he said he could not at present avail himself, for want of money to pay for his passage to London. This objection I soon removed, by putting five guineas into his hand, and telling him I thought myself extremely happy in having an opportunity of manifesting my gratitude to him in his necessity. But it was with the utmost difficulty I could prevail upon him to accept of two, which he affirmed were more than sufficient to defray the necessary expense.\n\nAfter this friendly contest was over, he proposed we should have a mess of something; \u201cFor,\u201d said he, \u201cit has been banyan day with me a great while. You must know I was shipwrecked, five days ago, near a place called Lisieux, in company with those Dutchmen who are now drinking below; and having but little money when I came ashore, it was soon spent, because I let them have share and share while it lasted. Howsomever, I should have remembered the old saying, every hog his own apple; for when they found my hold unstowed, they went all hands to shooling and begging; and, because I would not take a spell at the same duty, refused to give me the least assistance; so that I have not broke bread these two days.\u201d I was shocked at the extremity of his distress, and ordered some bread, cheese, and wine, to be brought immediately, to allay his hunger, until a fricassee of chickens could be prepared. When he had recruited his spirits with this homely fare, I desired to know the particulars of his peregrination since the accident at Cape Tiberoon, which were briefly these: The money he had about him being all spent at Port Louis, the civility and hospitality of the French cooled to such a degree, that he was obliged to list on board one of their king\u2019s ships as a common foremast man, to prevent himself from starving on shore. In this situation he continued two years, during which time he had acquired some knowledge of their language, and the reputation of a good seaman; the ship he belonged to was ordered home to France, where she was laid up as unfit for service, and he was received on board one of Monsieur D\u2019Antin\u2019s squadron, in quality of quartermaster; which office he performed in a voyage to the West Indies, where he engaged with our ship, as before related; but his conscience upbraiding him for serving the one enemies of his country, he quitted the ship at the same place where he first listed, and got to Curacoa in a Dutch vessel; there he bargained with a skipper, bound to Europe, to work for his passage to Holland, from whence he was in hopes of hearing from his friends in England; but was cast away, as he mentioned before, on the French coast, and must have been reduced to the necessity of travelling on foot to Holland, and begging for his subsistence on the road, or of entering on board of another French man-of-war, at the hazard of being treated as a deserter, if Providence had not sent me to his succour. \u201cAnd now, my lad,\u201d continued he, \u201cI think I shall steer my course directly to London, where I do not doubt of being replaced, and of having the R taken off me by the Lords of the Admiralty, to whom I intend to write a petition, setting forth my case; if I succeed, I shall have wherewithal to give you some assistance, because, when I left the ship, I had two years\u2019 pay due to me, therefore I desire to know whither you are bound: and besides, perhaps, I may have interest enough to procure a warrant appointing you surgeon\u2019s mate of the ship to which I shall belong\u2014for the beadle of the Admiralty is my good friend: and he and one of the under clerks are sworn brothers, and that under clerk has a good deal to say with one of the upper clerks, who is very well known to the under secretary, who, upon his recommendation, I hope, will recommend my affair to the first secretary; and he again will speak to one of the lords in my behalf; so that you see I do not want friends to assist me on occasion. As for the fellow Crampley, tho\u2019f I know him not, I am sure he is neither seaman nor officer, by what you have told me, or else he could never be so much mistaken in his reckoning, as to run the ship on shore on the coast of Sussex before he believed himself in soundings; neither, when that accident happened, would he have left the ship until she had been stove to pieces, especially when the tide was making; wherefore, by this time, I do suppose, he has been tried by a court-martial, and executed for his cowardice and misconduct.\u201d\n\nI could not help smiling at the description of my uncle\u2019s ladder, by which he proposed to climb to the attention of the board of admiralty; and, though I knew the world too well to confide in such dependence myself, I would not discourage him with doubts, but asked if he had no friend in London, who would advance a small sum of money to enable him to appear as he ought, and make a small present to the under secretary, who might possibly dispatch his business the sooner on that account. He scratched his head, and after some recollection, replied, \u201cWhy, yes, I believe Daniel Whipcord, the ship-chandler in Wapping, would not refuse me such a small matter. I know I can have what credit I want for lodging, liquor, and clothes; but as to money, I won\u2019t be positive. Had honest Block been living, I should not have been at loss.\u201d I was heartily sorry to find a worthy man so destitute of friends, when he had such need of them, and looked upon my own situation as less miserable than his, because I was better acquainted with the selfishness and roguery of mankind, consequently less liable to disappointment and imposition.\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nHe takes his passage in a cutter for Deal\u2014we are accosted by a Priest, who proves to be a Scotchman\u2014his profession on friendship\u2014he is affronted by the Lieutenant, who afterwards appeases him by submission\u2014my uncle embarks\u2014I am introduced by a Priest to a Capuchin, in whose company I set out for Paris\u2014the character of my fellow traveller\u2014on adventure on the road\u2014I am shocked at his behaviour\n\nWhen our repast was ended, we walked down to the harbour, where we found a cutter that was to sail for Deal in the evening, and Mr. Bowling agreed for his passage. In the meantime, we sauntered about the town to satisfy our curiosity, our conversation turning on the subject of my designs, which were not as yet fixed: neither can it be supposed that my mind was at ease, when I found myself reduced almost to extreme poverty, in the midst of foreigners, among whom I had not one acquaintance to advise or befriend me. My uncle was sensible of my forlorn condition, and pressed me to accompany him to England, where he did not doubt of finding some sort of provision for me; but besides the other reasons I had for avoiding that kingdom, I looked upon it, at this time, as the worst country in the universe for a poor honest man to live in; and therefore determined to remain in France, at all events.\n\nI was confirmed in this resolution by a reverend priest, who, passing by at this time, and overhearing us speak English, accosted us in the same language, telling us he was our countryman, and wishing it might be in his power to do us any service. We thanked this grave person for his courteous offer, and invited him to drink a glass with us, which he did not think proper to refuse, and we went altogether into a tavern of his recommending. After having drunk to our healths in a bumper of good Burgundy, he began to inquire into our situation, particularly the place of our nativity, which we no sooner named than he started up, and, wringing our hands with great fervour, shed a flood of tears, crying, \u201cI come from the same part of the country! perhaps you are my own relations.\u201d I was on my guard against his caresses, which I suspected very much, when I remembered the adventure of the money-dropper; but, without any appearance of diffidence, observed, that, as he was born in that part of the country, he must certainly know our families, which (howsoever mean our present appearance might be) were none of the most obscure or inconsiderable. Then I discovered our names, to which I found he was no stranger; he had known my grandfather personally; and, notwithstanding an absence of fifty years from Scotland, recounted so many particulars of the families in the neighbourhood, that my scruples were entirely removed, and I thought myself happy in his acquaintance. In the course of our conversation, I disclosed my condition without reserve, and displayed my talents to such advantage, that the old father looked upon me with admiration, and assured me, that, if I stayed in France, and listened to reason, I could not fail of making my fortune, to which he would contribute all in his power.\n\nMy uncle began to be jealous of the Priest\u2019s insinuation, and very abruptly declared, that if ever I should renounce my religion, he would break off all connection and correspondence with me; for it was his opinion, that no honest man would swerve from his principles in which he was bred, whether Turkish, Protestant, or Roman. The father, affronted at this declaration, with great vehemence began a long discourse, setting forth the danger of obstinacy, and shutting one\u2019s eyes against the light. He said, that ignorance would be no plea towards justification, when we had opportunities of being better informed; and, that, if the minds of people had not been open to conviction, the Christian religion could not have been propagated in the world, and we should now be in a state of Pagan darkness and barbarity: he endeavoured to prove, by some texts of Scripture and many quotations from the Fathers, that the Pope was the successor of St. Peter, and vicar of Jesus Christ; that the church of Rome was the true, holy, catholic church; and that the Protestant faith was an impious heresy and damnable schism, by which many millions of souls would suffer everlasting perdition. When he had finished his sermon, which I thought he pronounced with more zeal than discretion, he addressed himself to my uncle, desired to know his objections to what had been said. The lieutenant, whose attention had been wholly engrossed by his own affairs, took the pipe out of his mouth, and replied, \u201cAs for me, friend, d\u2019ye see, I have no objection to what you say; it may be either truth or false, for what I know; I meddle with nobody\u2019s affairs but my own; the gunner to his linstock, and the steersman to the helm, as the saying is. I trust to no creed but the compass, and do unto every man as I would be done by; so that I defy the Pope, the Devil, and the Pretender; and hope to be saved as well as another.\u201d This association of persons gave great offence to the friar, who protested, in a mighty passion, that if Mr. Bowling had not been his countryman, he would have caused him to be imprisoned for his insolence; I ventured to disapprove of my uncle\u2019s rashness, and appeased the old gentleman, by assuring him there was no offence intended by my kinsman, who, by this time sensible of his error, shook the injured party by the hand, and asked pardon for the freedom he had taken. Matters being amicably compromised, he invited us to come and see him in the afternoon at the convent to which he belonged, and took his leave for the present; when my uncle recommended it strongly to me to persevere in the religion of my forefathers, whatever advantages might propose to myself by a change, which could not fail of disgracing myself, and dishonouring my family. I assured him no consideration would induce me to forfeit his friendship and good opinion on that score; at which assurance he discovered great satisfaction, and put me in mind of dinner, which we immediately bespoke, and when it was ready, ate together.\n\nI imagined my acquaintance with the Scottish priest if properly managed, might turn out to my advantage, and therefore resolved to cultivate it as much as I could. With this view we visited him at his convent, according to his invitation, where he treated us with wine and sweetmeats, and showed us everything that was remarkable in the monastery. Having been thus entertained, we took our leave, though not before I had promised to see him next day, and the time fixed for my uncle\u2019s embarking being come, I accompanied him to the harbour, and saw him on board. We parted not without tears, after we had embraced and wished one another all manner of prosperity: and he entreated me to write to him often, directing to Lieutenant Bowling, at the sign of the Union Flag, near the Hermitage, London.\n\nI returned to the house in which we had met, where I passed the night in a very solitary manner, reflecting on the severity of my fate, and endeavouring to project some likely scheme of life for the future; but my invention failed me; I saw nothing but insurmountable difficulties in my way, and was ready to despair at the miserable prospect! That I might not, however, neglect any probable reason, I got up in the morning, and went directly to the father, whose advice and assistance I implored. He received me very kindly, and gave me to understand, that there was one way of life in which a person of my talents could not fail of making a great figure. I guessed his meaning, and told him, once for all, I was fully determined against any alteration in point of religion; therefore if his proposal regarded the church, he might save himself the trouble of explaining it. He shook his head and sighed, saying, \u201cAh! son, son, what a glorious prospect is here spoiled by your stubborn prejudice! Suffer yourself to be persuaded by reason, and consult your temporal welfare, as well as the concerns of your eternal soul. I can, by my interest procure your admission as a noviciate to this convent, where I will superintend and direct you with a truly paternal affection.\u201d Then he launched out into the praises of a monastic life, which no noise disturbs, no cares molest, and no danger invades\u2014where the heart is weaned from carnal attachments, the grosser appetite subdued and chastised, and the soul wafted to divine regions of philosophy and truth, on the wing of studious contemplation. But his eloquence was lost upon me, whom two considerations enabled to withstand his temptation; namely, my promise to my uncle, and my aversion to an ecclesiastical life; for as to the difference of religion, I looked upon it as a thing of too small moment to come in competition with a man\u2019s fortune. Finding me immovable on this head, he told me, he was more sorry than offended at my noncompliance, and still ready to employ his good offices in my behalf. \u201cThe same erroneous maxims,\u201d said he, \u201cthat obstruct your promotion in the church, will infallibly prevent your advancement in the army; but, if you can brook the condition of a servant, I am acquainted with some people of rank at Versailles, to whom I can give you letters of recommendation, that you may be entertained by some one of them in quality of maitre d\u2019hotel; and I do not doubt that your qualifications will soon entitle you to a better provision.\u201d I embraced his offer with great eagerness, and he appointed me to come back in the afternoon, when he would not only give me letters, but likewise introduce me to a capuchin of his acquaintance, who intended to set out for Paris next morning in whose company I might travel, without being at the expense of one livre during the whole journey. This piece of good news gave me infinite pleasure; I acknowledged my obligation to the benevolent father in the most grateful expressions; and he performed his promise to a tittle, in delivering the letters, and making me acquainted with the capuchin, with whom I departed next morning by break of day.\n\nIt was not long before I discovered my fellow traveller to be a merry facetious fellow, who, notwithstanding his profession and appearance of mortification, loved good eating and drinking better than his rosary, and paid more adoration to a pretty girl than to the Virgin Mary, or St. Genevieve. He was a thick brawny young man, with red eyebrows, a hook nose, a face covered with freckles; and his name was Frere Balthazar. His order did not permit him to wear linen, so that, having little occasion to undress himself, he was none of the cleanliest animals in the world; and his constitution was naturally so strongly scented that I always thought it convenient to keep to the windward of him in our march. As he was perfectly well known on the road, we fared sumptuously without any cost, and the fatigue of our journey was much alleviated by the good humour of my companion, who sang an infinite number of catches on the subjects of love and wine. We took up our lodging the first night at a peasant\u2019s house not far from Abbeville, where we were entertained with an excellent ragout, cooked by our landlord\u2019s daughters, one of whom was very handsome. After having eaten heartily and drank a sufficient quantity of small wine, we were conducted to a barn, where we found a couple of carpets spread upon clean straw for our reception. We had not lain in this situation above half-an-hour, when we heard somebody knock softly at the door, upon which Balthazar got up, and let in our host\u2019s two daughters, who wanted to have some private conversation with him in the dark. When they had whispered together some time, the capuchin came to me, and asked if I was insensible to love, and so hard-hearted as to refuse a share of my bed to a pretty maid who had a tendre for me? I must own to my shame, that I suffered myself to be overcome by my passion, and with great eagerness seized the occasion, when I understood that the amiable Nanette was to be my bedfellow. In vain did my reason suggest the respect that I owed to my dear mistress Narcissa; the idea of that lovely charmer rather increased than allayed the ferment of my spirits; and the young paysanne had no reason to complain of my remembrance. Early in the morning, the kind creatures left us to our repose, which lasted till eight o\u2019clock when we got up, and were treated at breakfast with chocolate and l\u2019eau-de-vie by our paramours, of whom we took a tender leave, after my companion had confessed and given them absolution.\n\nWhile we proceeded on our journey, the conversation turned upon the night\u2019s adventure, being introduced by the capuchin, who asked me how I liked my lodging; I declared my satisfaction, and talked in rapture of the agreeable Nanette, at which he shook his head, and smiling said, she was a morceau pour la bonne bouche. \u201cI never valued myself,\u201d continued he, \u201cupon anything so much as the conquest of Nanette; and, vanity apart, I have been pretty fortunate in my amours.\u201d This information shocked me not a little, as I was well convinced of his intimacy with her sister; and though I did not care to tax him with downright incest, I professed my astonishment at his last night\u2019s choice, when, I supposed, the other was at his devotion. To this hint he answered that, besides his natural complaisance to the sex, he had another reason to distribute his favours equally between them, namely, to preserve peace in the family, which could not otherwise be maintained; that, moreover, Nanette had conceived an affection for me, and he loved her too well to balk her inclination; more especially, when he had an opportunity of obliging his friend at the same time. I thanked him for this instance of his friendship, though I was extremely disgusted at his want of delicacy, and cursed the occasion that threw me in his way. Libertine as I was, I could not bear to see a man behave so wide of the character he assumed. I looked upon him as a person of very little worth or honesty, and should even have kept a wary eye upon my pocket, if I had thought he could have had any temptation to steal. But I could not conceive the use of money to a capuchin, who is obliged, by the rules of his order, to appear like a beggar, and enjoy all other necessaries of life gratis; besides, my fellow traveller seemed to be of a complexion too careless and sanguine to give me any apprehension on that score; so that I proceeded with great confidence, in expectation of being soon at my journey\u2019s end.\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nWe lodge at a House near Amiens, where I am robbed by the Capuchin, who escapes while I am asleep\u2014I go to Noyons in search of him, but without Success\u2014make my Condition known to several People, but find no Relief\u2014grow desperate\u2014find a Company of Soldiers\u2014Enlist in the Regiment of Picardy\u2014we are ordered into Germany\u2014I find the Fatigues of the March almost intolerable\u2014Quarrel with my Comrade in a dispute about Politics\u2014he challenges me to the Field\u2014wounds and disarms me\n\nThe third night of our pilgrimage we passed at a house near Amiens, where being unknown, we supped upon indifferent fare and sour wine, and were fain to be in a garret upon an old mattress, which, I believe had been in the possession of ten thousand myriads of fleas time out of mind. We did not invade their territory with impunity; in less than a minute we were attacked by stings innumerable, in spite of which, however, I fell fast asleep, being excessively fatigued with our day\u2019s march, and did not wake till nine next morning, when, seeing myself alone, I started up in a terrible fright, and, examining my pockets, found my presaging fear too true! My companion had made free with my cash, and left me to seek my way to Paris by myself! I ran down stairs immediately; and, with a look full of grief and amazement, inquired for the mendicant, who, they gave me to understand, had set out four hours before, after having told them I was a little indisposed, and desired I might not be disturbed, but be informed when I should wake, that he had taken the road to Noyons, where he would wait for my coming, at the Coq d\u2019Or. I spoke not a word, but with a heavy heart directed my course to that place, at which I arrived in the afternoon, fainting with weariness and hunger; but learned to my utter confusion, that no such person had been there! It was happy for me that I had a good deal of resentment in my constitution, which animated me on such occasions against the villainy of mankind, and enabled me to bear misfortunes, otherwise intolerable. Boiling with indignation, I discovered to the host my deplorable condition, and inveighed with great bitterness against the treachery of Balthazar; at which he shrugged up his shoulders, and with a peculiar grimace on his countenance, said, he was sorry for my misfortune, but there was no remedy like patience. At that instant some guests arrived, to whom he hastened to offer his service, leaving me mortified at his indifference, and fully persuaded that an innkeeper is the same sordid animal all the world over.\n\nWhile I stood in the porch forlorn and undetermined, venting ejaculations of curses against the thief who had robbed me, and the old priest who recommended him to my friendship, a young gentleman richly dressed, attended by a valet de chambre and two servants in livery, arrived at the inn. I thought I perceived a great deal of sweetness and good-nature in his countenance; therefore he had no sooner alighted than I accosted him, and, in a few words, explained my situation: he listened with great politeness, and, when I made an end of my story, said, \u201cWell, monsieur, what would you have me to do?\u201d I was effectually abashed at this interrogation, which, I believe, no man of common sense or generosity could make, and made no other compliment than a low bow: he returned the compliment still lower, and tripped into an apartment, while the landlord let me know that my standing there to interrupt company gave offence, and might do him infinite prejudice. He had no occasion to repeat his insinuation; I moved from the place immediately, and was so much transported with grief, anger, and disdain, that a torrent of blood gushed from my nostrils. In this ecstacy, I quitted Noyons, and betook myself to the fields, where I wandered about like one distracted, till my spirits were quite exhausted, and I was obliged to throw myself down at the root of a tree, to rest my wearied limbs. Here my rage forsook me: I began to feel the importunate cravings of nature, and relapsed into silent sorrow and melancholy reflection. I revolved all the crimes I had been guilty of and found them too few and venial, that I could not comprehend the justice of that Providence, which, after having exposed me to so much wretchedness and danger, left me a prey to famine at last in a foreign country, where I had not one friend or acquaintance to close my eyes, and do the last offices of humanity to my miserable carcass. A thousand times I wished myself a bear, that I might retreat to woods and deserts, far from the inhospitable haunts of man, where I could live by my own talents, independent of treacherous friends and supercilious scorn.\n\nAs I lay in this manner, groaning over my hapless fate, I heard the sound of a violin, and raising my head, perceived a company of men and women dancing on the grass at some distance from me. I looked upon this to be a favourable season for distress to attract compassion, when every selfish thought is banished, and the heart dilated with mirth and social joy; wherefore I got up, and approached those happy people, whom I soon discovered to be a party of soldiers, with their wives and children, unbending and diverting themselves at this rate, after the fatigue of a march. I had never before seen such a parcel of scarecrows together, neither could I reconcile their meagre and gaunt looks, their squalid and ragged attire, and every other external symptom of extreme woe, with this appearance of festivity. I saluted them, however, and was received with great politeness; after which they formed a ring, and danced around me. This jollity had a wonderful effect upon my spirits. I was infected with their gaiety, and in spite of my dismal situation, forgot my cares, and joined in their extravagance. When we had recreated ourselves a good while at this diversion, the ladies spread their manteaus on the ground, upon which they emptied their knapsacks of some onions, coarse bread, and a few flasks of poor wine: being invited to a share of the banquet, I sat down with the rest, and, in the whole course of my life, never made a more comfortable meal. When our repast was ended, we got up again to dance, and, now that I found myself refreshed I behaved to the admiration of everybody; I was loaded with a thousand compliments and professions of friendship: the men commended my person and agility, and the women were loud in the praise of my bonne grace; the sergeant in particular expressed so much regard for me, and described the pleasures of a soldier\u2019s life to me with so much art, that I began to listen to his proposal of enlisting me in the service; and the more I considered my own condition, the more I was convinced of the necessity I was under to come to a speedy determination.\n\nHaving, therefore, maturely weighed the circumstances pro and con I signified my consent, and was admitted into the regiment of Picardy, said to be the oldest corps in Europe. The company to which this commander belonged was quartered at a village not far off, whither we marched next day, and I was presented to my captain, who seemed very well pleased with my appearance, gave me a crown to drink, and ordered me to be accommodated with clothes, arms, and accoutrements. Then I sold my livery suit, purchased linen, and, as I was at great pains to learn the exercise, in a very short time became a complete soldier.\n\nIt was not long before we received orders to join several more regiments, and march with all expedition into Germany, in order to reinforce Mareschal Duc de Noailles, who was then encamped with his army on the side of the river Mayne, to watch the motions of the English, Hanoverians, Austrians, and Hessians, under the command of the Earl of Stair. We began our march accordingly, and then I became acquainted with that part of a soldier\u2019s life to which I had been hitherto a stranger. It is impossible to describe the hunger and thirst I sustained, and the fatigue I underwent in a march of so many hundred miles; during which, I was so much chafed with the heat and motion of my limbs, that in a very short time the inside of my thighs and legs were deprived of skin, and I proceeded in the utmost torture. This misfortune I owed to the plumpness of my constitution, which I cursed, and envied the withered condition of my comrades, whose bodies could not spare juice enough to supply a common issue, and were indeed proof against all manner of friction. The continual pain I felt made me fretful, and my peevishness was increased by the mortification of my pride in seeing those miserable wretches, whom a hard gale of wind would have scattered through the air like chaff, bear those toils with alacrity under which I was ready to sink.\n\nOne day, while we enjoyed a halt, and the soldiers with their wives had gone out to dance, according to custom, my comrade stayed at home with me on pretence of friendship, and insulted me with his pity and consolation! He told me that, though I was young and tender at present, I should soon be seasoned to the service; and he did not doubt but I should have the honour to contribute in some measure to the glory of the king. \u201cHave courage, therefore, my child,\u201d said he, \u201cand pray to the good God, that you may be as happy as I am, who have had the honour of serving Louis the Great, and of receiving many wounds, in helping to establish his glory.\u201d When I looked upon the contemptible object that pronounced these words, I was amazed at the infatuation that possessed him; and could not help expressing my astonishment at the absurdity of a rational who thinks himself highly honoured, in being permitted to encounter abject poverty, oppression, famine, disease, mutilation, and evident death merely to gratify the vicious ambition of a prince, by whom his sufferings were disregarded, and his name utterly unknown. I observed that, if his situation were the consequence of compulsion, I would praise his patience and fortitude in bearing his lot: if he had taken up arms in defence of his injured country, he was to be applauded for his patriotism: or if he had fled to this way of life as a refuge from a greater evil, he was justifiable in his own conscience (though I could have no notion of misery more extreme than he suffered); but to put his condition on the footing of conducing to the glory of his prince, was no more than professing himself a desperate slave, who voluntarily underwent the utmost wretchedness and peril, and committed the most flagrant crimes, to soothe the barbarous pride of a fellow-creature, his superior in nothing but the power he derived from the submission of such wretches as him. The soldier was very much affronted at the liberty I took with his king, which, he said, nothing but my ignorance could excuse: he affirmed that the characters of princes were sacred, and ought not to be profaned by the censure of their subjects, who were bound by their allegiance to obey their commands, of what nature soever, without scruple or repining; and advised me to correct the rebellious principles I had imbibed among the English, who, for their insolence to their kings, were notorious all over the world, even to a proverb.\n\nIn vindication of my countrymen, I repeated all the arguments commonly used to prove that every man has a natural right to liberty; that allegiance and protection are reciprocal; that, when the mutual tie is broken by the tyranny of the king, he is accountable to the people for his breach of contract, and subject to the penalties of the law; and that those insurrections of the English, which are branded with the name of rebellion by the slaves of arbitrary power, were no other than glorious efforts to rescue that independence which was their birthright, from the ravenous claws of usurping ambition. The Frenchman, provoked at the little deference I paid to the kingly name, lost all patience, and reproached me in such a manner that my temper forsook me, I clenched my fist, with an intention to give him a hearty box on the ear. Perceiving my design, he started back and demanded a parley; upon which I checked my indignation, and he gave me to understand that a Frenchman never forgave a blow; therefore, if I were not weary of my life, I would do well to spare him that mortification, and do him the honour of measuring his sword with mine, like a gentleman. I took his advice and followed him to a field hard by, where indeed I was ashamed at the pitiful figure of my antagonist, who was a poor little shivering creature, decrepit with age, and blind of one eye. But I soon found the folly of judging from appearances; being at the second pass wounded in the sword hand, and immediately disarmed with such a jerk, that I thought the joint was dislocated. I was no less confounded than enraged at this event, especially as my adversary did not bear his success with all the moderation that might have been expected; for he insisted upon my asking pardon for affronting his king and him. This proposal I would by no means comply with, but told him, it was a mean condescension, which no gentleman in his circumstances ought to propose, nor any in my situation ought to perform; and that, if he persisted in his ungenerous demand, I would in my turn claim satisfaction with my musket, when we should be more upon a par than with the sword, of which he seemed so much master.\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nIn order to be revenged, I learn the Science of Defence\u2014we join Mareschal Duc de Noailles, are engaged with the Allies of Dettingen, and put to flight\u2014the behaviour of the French soldiers on that occasion\u2014I industriously seek another combat with the old Gascon, and vanquish him in my turn\u2014our regiment is put into Winter Quarters at Rheims, where I find my friend Strap\u2014our Recognition\u2014he supplies me with Money, and procures my Discharge\u2014we take a trip to Paris; from whence, by the way of Flanders, we set out for London; where we safely arrive\n\nHe was disconcerted at this declaration, to which he made no reply, but repaired to the dancers, among whom he recounted his victory with many exaggerations and gasconades; while I, taking up my sword, went to my quarters, and examined my wound, which I found was of no consequence. The same day an Irish drummer, having heard of my misfortune, visited me, and after having condoled me on the chance of war, gave me to understand, that he was master of the sword, and would in a very short time instruct me so thoroughly in that noble science, that I should be able to chastise the old Gascon for his insolent boasting at my expense. This friendly office he proffered on pretence of the regard he had for his countrymen; but I afterwards learned the true motive was no other than a jealousy he entertained of a correspondence between the Frenchman and his wife, which he did not think proper to resent in person. Be this as it will, I accepted his offer and practised his lessons with such application, that I soon believed myself a match for my conqueror. In the meantime we continued our march, and arrived at the Camp of Mareschal Noailles the night before the battle at Dettingen: notwithstanding the fatigue we had undergone, our regiment was one of those that were ordered next day to cross the river, under the command of the Duc de Grammont, to take possession of a narrow defile, through which the allies must of necessity have passed at a great disadvantage, or remain where they were, and perish for want of provision, if they would not condescend to surrender at discretion. How they suffered themselves to be pent up in this manner it is not my province to relate; I shall only observe that, when we had taken possession of our ground, I heard an old officer in conversation with another express a surprise at the conduct of Lord Stair, who had the reputation of a good general. But it seems, at this time, that nobleman was overruled, and only acted in an inferior character; so that no part of the blame could be imputed to him, who declared his disapprobation of the step, in consequence of which the whole army was in the utmost danger; but Providence or destiny acted miracles in their behalf, by disposing the Duc de Grammont to quit his advantageous post, pass the defile, and attack the English, who were drawn up in order of battle on the plain, and who handled us so roughly that, after having lost a great number of men, we turned our backs without ceremony, and fled with such precipitation that many hundreds perished in the river through pure fear and confusion: for the enemy were so generous that they did not pursue us one inch of ground; and, if our consternation would have permitted, we might have retreated with great order and deliberation. But, notwithstanding the royal clemency of the king of Great Britain, who headed the allies in person, and, no doubt, put a stop to the carnage, our loss amounted to five thousand men, among whom were many officers of distinction. Our miscarriage opened a passage for the foe to Haynau, whither they immediately marched, leaving their sick and wounded to the care of the French, who next day took possession of the field of battle, buried the dead, and treated the living with humanity.\n\nThis circumstance was a great consolation to us, who thence took occasion to claim the victory; and the genius of the French nation never appeared more conspicuous than now, in the rhodomontades they uttered on the subject of their generosity and courage. Every man (by his own account) performed feats that eclipsed all the heroes of antiquity. One compared himself to a lion retiring at leisure from his cowardly pursuers, who keep at a wary distance, and gall him with their darts. Another likened himself to a bear that retreats with his face to the enemy, who dare not assail him; and the third assumed the character of a desperate stag, that turns upon the hounds and keeps them at bay. There was not a private soldier engaged who had not by the prowess of his single arm demolished a whole platoon, or put a squadron of horse to flight; and, among others, the meagre Gascon extolled his exploits above those of Hercules or Charlemagne. As I still retained my resentment for the disgrace I suffered in my last rencontre with him, and, now that I thought myself qualified, longed for an opportunity to retrieve my honour, I magnified the valour of the English with all the hyperboles I could imagine, and described the pusillanimity of the French in the same style, comparing them to hares flying before greyhounds, or mice pursued by cats; and passed an ironical compliment on the speed he exerted in his flight, which, considering his age and infirmities I said was surprising. He was stung to the quick by this sarcasm, and, with an air of threatening disdain, bade me know myself better, and remember the correction I had already received from him for my insolence; for he might not always be in the humour of sparing a wretch who abused his goodness. To this inuendo I made no reply but by a kick on the breech, which overturned him in an instant. He started up with wonderful agility, and, drawing his sword, attacked me with great fury. Several people interposed, but, when he informed them of its being an affair of honour, they retired, and left us to decide the battle by ourselves. I sustained his onset with little damage, having only received a small scratch on my right shoulder, and, seeing his breath and vigour almost exhausted, assaulted him in my turn, closed with him, and wrested his sword out of his hand in the struggle. Having thus acquired the victory, I desired him to beg his life; to which demand he made no answer, but shrugged up his shoulders to his ears, expanded his hands, elevated the skin on his forehead and eyebrows, and depressed the corners of his mouth in such a manner, that I could scarce refrain from laughing aloud at his grotesque appearance. That I might, however, mortify his vanity, which triumphed without bounds over my misfortune, I thrust his sword up to the hilt in something (it was not a tansy), that lay smoking on the plain, and joined the rest of the soldiers with an air of tranquillity and indifference.\n\nThere was nothing more of moment attempted by either of the armies during the remaining part of the campaign, which being ended, the English marched back to the Netherlands; part of our army was detached to French Flanders, and our regiment ordered into winter quarters in Champagne. It was the fate of the grenadier company, to which I now belonged, to lie at Rheims, where I found myself in the utmost want of everything, my pay, which amounted to five sols a day, far from supplying me with necessaries, being scarce sufficient to procure a wretched subsistence to keep soul and body together; so that I was, by hunger and hard duty, brought down to the meagre condition of my fellow-soldiers, and my linen reduced from three tolerable shirts to two pair of sleeves and necks, the bodies having been long ago converted into spatterdaches; and after all, I was better provided than any private man in the regiment. In this urgency of my affairs, I wrote to my uncle in England, though my hopes from that quarter were not at all sanguine, for the reasons I have already explained; and in the meantime had recourse to my old remedy patience, consoling myself with the flattering suggestions of a lively imagination, that never abandoned me in my distress.\n\nOne day, while I stood sentinel at the gate of a general officer, a certain nobleman came to the door, followed by a gentleman in mourning, to whom, at parting, I heard him say, \u201cYou may depend upon my good offices.\u201d This assurance was answered by a low bow of the person in black, who, turning to go away, discovered to me the individual countenance of my old friend and adherent Strap. I was so much astonished at the sight, that I lost the power of utterance, and, before I could recollect myself, he was gone without taking any notice of me. Indeed, had he stayed, I scarcely should have ventured to accost him; because, though I was perfectly well acquainted with the features of his face, I could not be positively certain as to the rest of his person, which was very much altered for the better since he left me at London, neither could I conceive by which means he was enabled to appear in the sphere of a gentleman, to which, while I knew him, he had not even the ambition to aspire. But I was too much concerned in the affair to neglect further information, and therefore took the first opportunity of asking the porter if he knew the gentleman to whom the marquis spoke. The Swiss told me his name was Monsieur d\u2019Estrapes, that he had been valet-de-chambre to an English gentleman lately deceased, and that he was very much regarded by the marquis for his fidelity to his master, between whom and that nobleman a very intimate friendship had subsisted. Nothing could be more agreeable to me than this piece of intelligence, which banished all doubt of its being my friend, who had found means to frenchify his name as well as his behaviour since we parted. As soon, therefore, as I was relieved, I went to his lodging, according to a direction given me by the Swiss, and had the good fortune to find him at home. That I might surprise him the more, I concealed my name and business, and only desired the servant of the house to tell Monsieur d\u2019Estrapes that I begged the honour of half-an-hour\u2019s conversation with him. He was confounded and dismayed at this message, when he understood it was sent by a soldier; though he was conscious to himself of no crime, all that he had heard of the Bastille appeared to his imagination with aggravated horror, but it was not before I had waited a considerable time that he had resolution enough to bid the servant show me up-stairs.\n\nWhen I entered his chamber, he returned my bow with great civility, and endeavoured, with forced complaisance, to disguise his fear, which appeared in the paleness of his face, the wildness of his looks, and the shaking of his limbs. I was diverted at his consternation, which redoubled, when I told him in French, I had business for his private ear and demanded a particular audience. The valet being withdrawn, I asked in the same language if his name was d\u2019Estrapes, to which he answered with a faltering tongue, \u201cThe same, at your service.\u201d \u201cAre you a Frenchman?\u201d Said I. \u201cI have not the honour of being a Frenchman born,\u201d replied he, \u201cbut I have an infinite veneration for the country.\u201d I then desired he would do me the honour to look at me, which he no sooner did than, struck with my appearance, he started back, and cried in English, \u201cO Jesus!\u2014sure it can\u2019t! No \u2019tis impossible!\u201d I smiled at his interjections, saying, \u201cI suppose you are too much of a gentleman to own your friend in adversity.\u201d When he heard me pronounce these words in our own language, he leaped upon me in a transport of joy, hung about my neck, kissed me from ear to ear, and blubbered like a great schoolboy who had been whipped. Then, observing my dress, he set up his throat, crying, \u201cO Lord! O Lord! that ever I should live to see my dearest friend reduced to the condition of a foot soldier in the French service! Why did you consent to my leaving you?\u2014but I know the reason\u2014you thought you had got more creditable friends, and grew ashamed of my acquaintance. Ah! Lord help us! though I was a little short-sighted, I was not altogether blind: and though I did not complain, I was not the less sensible of your unkindness, which was indeed the only thing that induced me to ramble abroad, the Lord knows whither; but I must own it has been a lucky ramble for me, and so I forgive you, and may God forgive you! O Lord! Lord! is it come to this?\u201d I was nettled at the charge, which, though just, I could not help thinking unseasonable, and told him with some tartness that, whether his suspicions were well or ill grounded, he might have chosen a more convenient opportunity of introducing them; and that the question now was whether or no he found himself disposed to lend me any assistance. \u201cDisposed!\u201d replied he with great emotion; \u201cI thought you had known me so well as to assure yourself without asking, that I, and all that belongs to me, are at your command. In the meantime you shall dine with me, and I will tell you something that, perhaps, will not be displeasing unto you.\u201d Then, wringing my hand, he said, \u201cIt makes my heart bleed to see you in that garb!\u201d I thanked him for his invitation, which, I observed, could not be unwelcome to a person who had not eaten a comfortable meal these seven months; but I had another request to make, which I begged he would grant before dinner, and that was the loan of a shirt; for although my back had been many weeks a stranger to any comfort of that kind, my skin was not yet familiarised to the want of it. He stared in my face, with a woful countenance, at this declaration, which he could scarce believe, until I explained it by unbuttoning my coat and disclosing my naked body\u2014a circumstance which shocked the tender-hearted Strap, who, with tears in his eyes, ran to a chest of drawers, and taking out some linen, presented to me a very fine ruffled Holland shirt and cambric neckcloth, assuring me he had three dozen of the same kind at my service.\n\nI was ravished at this piece of good news and, having accommodated myself in a moment, hugged my benefactor for his generous offer, saying, I was overjoyed to find him undebauched by prosperity, which seldom fails to corrupt the heart. He bespoke for dinner some soup and bouilli, a couple of pullets roasted, and a dish of asparagus, and in the interim entertained me with biscuit and Burgundy, after which repast he entreated me to gratify his longing desire of knowing every circumstance of my fortune since his departure from London. This request I complied with, beginning at the adventure of Gawky, and relating every particular event in which I had been concerned from that day to the present hour. During the recital, my friend was strongly affected, according to the various situations described. He stared with surprise, glowed with indignation, gaped with curiosity, smiled with pleasure, trembled with fear, and wept with sorrow, as the vicissitudes of my life inspired these different passions; and, when my story was ended, signified his amazement on the whole, by lifting up his eyes and hands and protesting that, though I was a young man, had suffered more than all the blessed martyrs.\n\nAfter dinner, I desired in my turn to know the particulars of his peregrination, and he satisfied me in a few words, by giving me to understand that he had lived a year at Paris with his master, who, in that time having acquired the language, as well as the fashionable exercises to perfection, made a tour of France and Holland, during which excursion he was so unfortunate as to meet with three of his own countrymen on their travels, in whose company he committed such excesses, that his constitution failed, and he fell into a consumption; that by the advice of physicians, he went to Montpelier for the benefit of good air, and recovered so well in six weeks, that he returned to Rheims seemingly in good health, where he had not continued above a month, when he was seized with a looseness that carried him off in ten days, to the unspeakable sorrow of all who knew him and especially of Strap, who had been very happy in his service, and given such satisfaction, that his master, on his death-bed recommended him to several persons of distinction for his diligence, sobriety, and affection, and left him by will his wearing apparel, gold watch, sword, rings, ready money, and all the moveables he had in France, to the value of three hundred pounds \u201cwhich I now,\u201d said he, \u201cin the sight of God and man, surrender to your absolute disposal: here are my keys; take them, I beseech you, and God give you joy of the possession.\u201d My brain was almost turned by this sudden change of fortune, which I could scarce believe real: however, I positively refused this extravagant proffer of my friend, and put him in mind of my being a soldier; at which hint he started, crying, \u201cOdso! that\u2019s true! we must procure your discharge. I have some interest with a nobleman who is able to do me that favour.\u201d\n\nWe consulted about this affair, and it was determined that Monsieur d\u2019Estrapes should wait upon the Marquis in the morning, and tell him he had by accident found his brother, whom he had not seen for many years before, a private soldier in the regiment of Picardy, and implore that nobleman\u2019s interest for his discharge. In the meantime, we enjoyed ourselves over a bottle of good Burgundy, and spent the evening in concerting schemes for our future conduct, in case I should be so lucky as to get rid of the army. The business was to make ourselves easy for life by means of his legacy, a task very difficult, and, in the usual methods of laying out money, altogether impracticable, so that, after much canvassing, we could come to no resolution that night, but when we parted, recommended the matter to the serious attention of each other. As for my own part, I puzzled my imagination to no purpose. When I thought of turning merchant, the smallness of our stock, and the risk of seas, enemies, and markets, deterred me from that scheme. If I should settle as a surgeon in my own country, I would find the business already overstocked; or, if I pretended to set up in England, must labour under want of friends and powerful opposition, obstacles insurmountable by the most shining merit: neither should I succeed in my endeavours to rise in the state, inasmuch as I could neither flatter nor pimp for courtiers, nor prostitute my pen in defence of a wicked and contemptible administration. Before I could form any feasible project, I fell asleep, and my fancy was blest with the image of the dear Narcissa, who seemed to smile upon my passion, and offer her hand as a reward for all my toils.\n\nEarly in the morning, I went to the lodgings of my friend, whom I found exulting over his happy invention! for I no sooner entered his apartment, than he addressed himself to me in these words, with a smile of self-applause: \u201cWell, Mr. Random, a lucky thought may come into a fool\u2019s head sometimes. I have hit it\u2014I\u2019ll hold you a button my plan is better than yours, for all your learning. But you shall have the preference in this as in all other things; therefore proceed, and let us know the effects of your meditation; and then I will impart my own simple excogitations.\u201d I told him, that not one thought had occurred to me which deserved the least notice, and signified my impatience to be acquainted with the fruits of his reflection. \u201cAs we have not,\u201d said he, \u201cmoney sufficient to maintain us during a tedious expectation, it is my opinion that a bold push must be made; and I see none so likely to succeed as your appearing in the character of a gentleman (which is your due), and making your addresses to some lady of fortune, who can render you independent at once. Nay, don\u2019t stare\u2014I affirm that this scheme is both prudent and honourable; for I would not have you throw yourself away upon an old toothless wheezing dame, whose breath would stink you into a consumption in less than three months, neither would I advise you to assume the character of a wealthy squire, as your common fortune-hunters do, by which means many a poor lady is cheated into matrimony, and instead of enjoying the pomp and grandeur that was promised, sees her dowry seized by her husband\u2019s rapacious creditors, and herself reduced to misery and despair. No, I know you have a soul that disdains such imposition; and are master of qualifications, both of mind and body, which alone entitle you to a match that will set you above the world. I have clothes in my possession that a duke need not be ashamed to wear. I believe they will fit you as they are, if not there are plenty of tailors in France. Let us take a short trip to Paris, and provide ourselves with all other necessaries, then set out for England, where I intend to do myself the honour of attending you in quality of a valet. This expedient will save you the expense of a servant, shaving, and dressing; and I doubt not but, by the blessing of God, we shall bring matters to a speedy and fortunate issue.\u201d Extravagant as this proposal was, I listened to it with pleasure, because it flattered my vanity, and indulged a ridiculous hope I began to entertain of inspiring Narcissa with a mutual flame.\n\nAfter breakfast, Monsieur d\u2019Estrapes went to pay his devoirs to the marquis, and was so successful in his application, that I obtained a discharge in a few days, upon which we set out for Paris. Here I had time to reflect and congratulate myself upon this sudden transition of fate, which to bear with moderation required some degree of philosophy and self-denial. This truth will be more obvious, if I give a detail of the particulars, to the quiet possession of which I was raised in an instant, from the most abject misery and contempt. My wardrobe consisted of five fashionable coats full mounted, two of which were plain, one of cut velvet, one trimmed with gold, and another with silver lace, two frocks, one of white drab, with large plate buttons, the other of blue with gold binding; one waistcoat of gold brocade; one of blue satin, embroidered with silver; one of green silk, trimmed with figured broad gold lace; one of black silk, with fringes; one of white satin, one of black cloth, and one of scarlet; six pair of cloth breeches; one pair of crimson, and another of black velvet; twelve pair of white silk stockings, as many of black silk, and the same number of white cotton; one hat, laced with gold point d\u2019Espagne, another with silver lace scolloped, a third with gold binding, and a fourth plain; three dozen of fine ruffled shirts, as many neckcloths; one dozen of cambric handkerchiefs, and the like number of silk. The other moveables, which I possessed by the generosity and friendship of Strap, were a gold watch with a chased case, two valuable diamond rings, two mourning swords, one with a silver handle, and a fourth cut steel inlaid with gold, a diamond stock buckle, and a set of stone buckles for the knees and shoes; a pair of silver-mounted pistols with rich housings; a gold-headed cane, and a snuff-box of tortoiseshell, mounted with gold, having the picture of a lady in the top. The gentleman left many other things of value, which my friend had converted into cash before I met with him; so that, over and above these particulars, our stock in ready money amounted to something more than two hundred pounds.\n\nThus equipped, I put on the gentleman of figure, and, attended by my honest friend, who was contented with the station of my valet, visited the Louvre, examined the gallery of Luxembourg, and appeared at Versailles, where I had the honour of seeing his Most Christian Majesty eat a considerable quantity of olives. During the month I spent at Paris, I went several times to court, the Italian comedy, opera, and playhouse, danced at a masquerade, and, in short, saw everything remarkable in and about that capital. Then we set out for England by the way of Flanders, passed through Brussels, Ghent, and Bruges, and took shipping at Ostend, from whence, in fourteen hours, we arrived at Deal, hired a postchaise, and in twelve hours more got safe to London, having disposed of our heavy baggage in the waggon.\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nI inquire for my Uncle, and understand he is gone to sea\u2014take Lodgings at Charing Cross\u2014go to the Play, where I meet with an adventure\u2014Dine at an ordinary\u2014the Guests described\u2014become acquainted with Medlar and Doctor Wagtail\n\nAs soon as we alighted at the inn, I dispatched Strap to inquire for my uncle at the Union Flag in Wapping; and he returned in a little time, with an account of Mr. Bowling\u2019s having gone to sea, mate of a merchant ship, after a long and unsuccessful application attendance at the Admiralty; where, it seems, the interest he depended upon was not sufficient to reinstate him, or recover the pay that was due to him when he quitted the Thunder.\n\nNext day I hired very handsome lodgings not far from Charing Cross; and in the evening dressed myself in a plain suit of the true Paris cut, and appeared in a front box at the play, where I saw a good deal of company, and was vain enough to believe that I was observed with an uncommon degree of attention and applause. This silly conceit intoxicated me so much, that I was guilty of a thousand ridiculous coquetries; and I dare say, how favourable soever the thoughts of the company might be at my first appearance, they were soon changed by my absurd behaviour into pity or contempt. I rose and sat down, covered and uncovered my head twenty times between the acts; pulled out my watch, clapped it to my ear, wound it up, set it, gave it the hearing again; displayed my snuff-box, affected to take snuff, that I might have all opportunity of showing my brilliant, and wiped my nose with perfumed handkerchief; then dangled my cane, and adjusted my sword-knot, and acted many more fooleries of the same kind, in hopes of obtaining the character of a pretty fellow, in the acquiring of which I found two considerable obstructions in my disposition\u2014namely, a natural reserve and jealous sensibility. Fain would I have entered into conversation with the people around me: but I was restrained by the fear of being censured for my assurance, as well as by reflecting that I was more entitled to a compliment of this kind from them, than they to such condescension from a stranger like me. How often did I redden at the frequent whispers and loud laughter of my fellow beaux, which I imagined were excited by me; and how often did I envy the happy indifference of those choice spirits, who behold the distress of the scene without discovering the least symptom of approbation or concern. My attention was engaged in spite of myself, and I could not help weeping with the heroine of the stage, though I practised a great many shifs to conceal this piece of unpolite weakness.\n\nWhen the play was ended, I sat waiting for an opportunity of handing some lady to her coach; but everyone was attended by such a number of officious gallants, that for a long time I was balked in my expectation. At length, however, I perceived a very handsome creature, genteelly dressed, sitting by herself in a box, at some distance from me; upon which I went up to her, and offered my service. She seemed to be in some confusion, thanked me for my complaisance, and with a tender look declined giving me the trouble: looking at her watch, and testifying her surprise at the negligence of her footman whom she had ordered to have a chair ready for her at that hour. I repeated my entreaty with all the eloquence and compliment I was master of; and, in the event, she was prevailed upon to accept of a proposal I made, to send my servant for a chair or coach: accordingly, Strap was detached for that purpose, and returned without success. By this time the playhouse was quite empty, and we were obliged to retire. As I led her through the passage, I observed five or six young fellows of fashion standing in a corner, one of whom, as I thought, tipped my charmer the wink, and when we were passed, I heard a loud laugh. This note aroused my attention, and I was resolved to be fully satisfied of this lady\u2019s character, before I should have any nearer connection with her. As no convenience appeared, I proposed to conduct her to a tavern, where we might stay a few minutes, until my servant could fetch a coach from the Strand. She seemed particularly shy of trusting herself in a tavern with a stranger, but at last yielded to my pathetic remonstrances, rather than endanger her health by remaining in a cold, damp thoroughfare. Having thus far succeeded, I begged to know what wine she would be pleased to drink a glass of; but she professed the greatest aversion to all sorts of strong liquors, and it was with much difficulty that I could persuade her to eat a jelly.\n\nIn the meantime, I endeavoured to alleviate the uneasiness she discovered, by saying all the agreeable things I could think of; at which she would often sigh, and regard me with a languishing look, that seemed, however, too near akin to the lewd leer of a courtesan. This discovery added to my former suspicion, while it put me upon my guard against her arts, divested me of reserve, and enabled me to entertain her with gaiety and freedom. In the course of our conversation, I pressed her to allow me the honour of waiting upon her next day at her lodgings, a request which she, with many apologues, refused, lest it should give umbrage to Sir John, who was of a disposition apt to be fretted with trifles. This information, by which I was to understand that her husband was a knight, did not check my addresses, which became more and more importunate, and I was even hardy enough to ravish a kiss. But, O heavens! instead of banqueting on the ambrosial flavour, that her delicacy of complexion promised, I was almost suffocated with the steams of Geneva! An exhalation of this kind, from a mouth which had just before declared an utter abhorrence of all spirituous liquors, not only changed my doubts into certainty, but my raptures into loathing; and it would have been impossible for me to have preserved common complaisance five minutes longer, when my servant returned with a coach. I took the advantage of this occasion, and presented my hand to the lady, who put in practice against me the whole artillery of her charms, ogling, languishing, sighing, and squeezing, with so little reserve that Strap perceived her tenderness, and rubbed his hands with joy as he followed us to the door; but I was proof against all her endearments, and handed her into the coach with an intention to take my leave immediately. She guessed my design, and invited me to her house, whispering, that now Sir John was gone to bed, she could have the pleasure of my conversation for half-an-hour without interruption. I told her there was no mortification I would not undergo, rather than endanger the repose of her ladyship; and, bidding the coachman drive on, wished her a good night. She lost all temper at my indifference, and, stopping the coach, at the distance of about twenty yards from me, popped out her head, and howled with the lungs of a fishwoman, \u201cD\u2014n you, you dog, won\u2019t you pay the coach-hire?\u201d As I made no answer, she held forth against me with an eloquence peculiar to herself; calling me pitifull fellow, scoundrel, and a hundred such appellations; concluding with an oath, that, for all my appearance, she believed I had got no money in my pocket.\n\nHaving thus vented her indignation, she ordered her coachman to proceed, and I returned to the tavern, where I bespoke something for supper, very well pleased at the issue of this adventure. I dispensed with the attendance of the waiter at table, on pretence that my own servant was present, and, when we were alone, said to Strap, \u201cWell, Monsieur d\u2019Estrapes, what d\u2019ye think of this lady?\u201d My friend, who had not opened his mouth since her departure, could make no other reply than the monosyllable \u201cThink!\u201d which he pronounced with a note of fear and astonishment. Surprised at this emphasis, I surveyed my valet, and, perceiving a wildness in his looks, asked if he had seen his grandfather\u2019s ghost? \u201cGhost!\u201d said he, \u201cI am sure I have seen a devil incarnate! Who would have thought that so much devilish malice and Billingsgate could lurk under so much sweetness of countenance and modesty of behaviour? Ah! God help us! Fronti nulla fides\u2014nimium ne crede colori\u2014but we ought to down on our knees, and bless God for delivering us from the jaws of that painted sepulchre!\u201d I was pretty much of Strap\u2019s opinion, and, though I did not believe myself in any danger from the allurements of that sisterhood, I determined to act with great circumspection for the future, and shun all commerce of that kind, as equally prejudicial to my purse and constitution.\n\nMy next care was to introduce myself into a set of good acquaintance: for which purpose I frequented a certain coffee-house, noted for the resort of good company, English as well as foreigners, where my appearance procured all the civilities and advances I could desire. As there was an ordinary in the same house, I went upstairs to dinner with the other guests, and found myself at a table with thirteen people, the greatest part of whom were better dressed than myself. The conversation, which was mostly carried on in French, turned chiefly on politics; and I soon found the whole company were in the French interest, myself excepted, and a testy old gentleman, who contradicted everything that was advanced in favour of his Most Christian Majesty, with a surliness truly English. But this trusty patriot, who had never been out of his own country, and drew all his maxims and notions from prejudice and hearsay, was very unequal to his antagonists, who were superior to him in learning and experience, and often took the liberty of travellers in asserting things which were not strictly true, because they thought themselves in no danger of being detected by him. The claim of the Queen Of Spain to the Austrian dominions in Italy was fully explained and vindicated, by a person who sat opposite to me, and, by the solemnity of his manner and the richness of his apparel, seemed to be a foreign ambassador. This dissertation produced another on the Pragmatic Sanction, handled with great warmth by a young gentleman at my right hand, dressed in a green frock, trimmed with gold, who justified the French king for his breach of that contract; and affirmed that he could not have observed it without injuring his own glory. Although I was not at all convinced by this gentleman\u2019s arguments, I could not help admiring his vivacity which, I imagined, must be the effect of his illustrious birth and noble education, and accordingly rated him, in my conjecture, as a young prince on his travels. The discourse was afterwards shifted by an old gentleman, of a very martial appearance, to the last campaign, when the battle of Dettingen was fought over again, with so many circumstances to the honour of the French and disadvantages if the Allies, that I began to entertain some doubts of my having been there in person, and took the liberty to mention some objections to what he advanced. This freedom introduced a dispute, which lasted a good while, to the mortification of all present; and was at last referred to the determination of a grave person, whom they styled Doctor, and who, under a show of great moderation, decided it against me, with so little regard to truth, that I taxed him with partiality in pretty severe terms, to the no small entertainment of the true English politician, who rejoiced at my defence of a cause he had so often espoused without success.\n\nMy opponent, pleased with the victory he had gained, affected a great deal of candour, and told me, he should not have been so positive, if he had not been at great pains to inform himself of each particular. \u201cIndeed,\u201d said he, \u201cI am convinced that the previous steps considered, things could not happen otherwise; for we generals who have seen service, though we may not be on the spot ourselves, know by the least sketch of the disposition what must be the event.\u201d He then censured, with great freedom, every circumstance of the conduct of those who commanded the Allies; from thence made a transition to the ministry, which he honoured with many invectives for employing people who had neither experience nor capacity, to the prejudice of old officers, who had been distinguished for both; dropped many hints of his own importance, and concluded with observing, that the French and Spaniards knew better how to value generals of merit; the good effects of which are seen in the conquests they gain, and the discipline of their troops, which are at the same time better clothed and paid than any soldiers in the universe. These remarks furnished the green knight with an opportunity of launching out in the praise of the French government in general, civil as well as military; on which occasion he made many odious comparisons to the disadvantage of the English. Everybody, almost, assented to the observations he made, and the doctor gave his sanction, by saying, the people of France were undoubtedly the happiest subjects in the world. I was so much astonished and confounded at their infatuation and effrontery, that I had not power to utter one word in opposition to their assertions; but my morose associate could not put up with the indignity that was offered to Old England, and therefore with a satirical grin addressed himself to the general in these words: \u201cSir, sir, I have often heard it said, She\u2019s a villainous bird that befouls her own nest. As for what those people who are foreigners say, I don\u2019t mind it; they know no better; but you who were bred and born, and have got your bread, under the English government, should have more regard to gratitude, as well as truth in censuring your native country. If the ministry have thought fit to lay you aside, I suppose they have their own reasons for so doing; and you ought to remember, that you still live on the bounty of this nation. As for these gentlemen (meaning the prince and ambassador), who make so free with our constitution, laws, and genius of our people, I think they might show a little more respect for their benefactors, who, I must own, are to blame in harbouring and protecting, and encouraging such ungrateful vagrants as they are.\u201d At these words, the chevalier in green started up in a great passion, and laying his hand on the hilt of his hanger, exclaimed, \u201cAh! foutre!\u201d The Englishman on the other hand, grasping his cane cried, \u201cDon\u2019t foutre me, sirrah, or by G\u2014d I\u2019ll knock you down.\u201d The company interposed, the Frenchman sat down again, and his antagonist proceeded\u2014\u201cLookey, Monsieur, you know very well that had you dared to speak so freely of the administration of your own country in Paris as you have done of ours in London, you would have been sent to the Bastille without ceremony, where you might have rotted in a dungeon, and never seen the light of the sun again. Now, sir, take my word for it, although our constitution screens us from such oppression, we want not laws to chastise the authors of seditious discourse, and if I hear another syllable out of your mouth in contempt or prejudice of this kingdom, I will give you a convincing proof of what I advance, and have you laid by the heels for your presumption.\u201d This declaration had an effect on the company as sudden as surprising. The young prince became as supple as a spaniel, the ambassador trembled, the general sat silent and abashed, and the doctor, who it seems, had felt the rod of power, grew pale as death, and assured us all, that he had no intention to affront any person or people. \u201cYour principles, doctor,\u201d resumed the old gentleman, \u201care no secret\u2014I have nothing to say upon that head; but am very much surprised, that a man who despises us so much, should notwithstanding live among us, when he has no visible motive for so doing. Why don\u2019t you take up your habitation in your beloved France, where you may rail at England without censure?\u201d To this remonstrance the doctor thought proper to make no reply, and an unsocial silence ensued; which I perceiving, took notice, that it was pity such idle disputes, maintained very often through whim or diversion, should create any misunderstanding among gentlemen of good sense, and proposed to drink down all animosity in another bottle.\n\nThis motion was applauded by the whole company. The wine was brought, and the English champion, declaring he had no spleen against any man for differing in opinion from him, any more than for difference of complexion, drank to the good health of all present; the compliment was returned, and the conversation once more became unreserved though more general than before. Among other topics, the subject of war was introduced, on which the general declaimed with great eloquence, recounting many of his own exploits by way of illustration. In the course of his harangue he happened to mention the word epaulement, upon which the testy gentleman asked the meaning, of that term. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what an epaulement is,\u201d replied he, \u201cI never saw an epaulement but once, and that was at the siege of Namur. In a council of war, Monsieur Cohorn, the famous engineer, affirmed that the place could not be taken.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said the Prince of Vandemont, \u201cit may be taken by an epaulement.\u201d \u201cThis was immediately put into execution, and in twenty-four hours Mareschal Boufflers was fain to capitulate.\u201d Here he made a full stop, and the old gentleman repeated the question, \u201cBut pray what is an epaulement?\u201d To this interrogation the officer made no immediate reply, but rang the bell, and called for the bill, which being brought, he threw down his proportion of the reckoning, and, telling the company he would show them an epaulement when his majesty should think fit to entrust him with the command of our army abroad, strutted away with great dignity. I could not imagine why he was so shy of explaining one of the most simple terms of fortification, which I forthwith described as a side-work composed of earth, gabions, or fascines; but I was very much surprised when I afterwards understood that his reserve proceeded from his ignorance.\n\nHaving paid our bill, we adjourned to the coffee-room, where my fellow-labourer insisted on treating me with a dish, giving me to understand, at the same time, that I had acquired his good opinion, both with respect to my principles and understanding. I thanked him for his compliment, and, professing myself an utter stranger in this part of the world, begged he would have the goodness to inform me of the quality and characters of the people who dined above. This request was a real favour to one of his disposition, which was no less communicative than curious; he therefore complied with great satisfaction, and told me, to my extreme astonishment, that the supposed young prince was a dancer at one of the theatres, and the ambassador no other than a fiddler belonging to the opera. \u201cThe doctor,\u201d said he \u201cis a Roman Catholic priest, who sometimes appears in the character of an officer, and assumes the name of captain; but more generally takes the garb, title, and behaviour of a physician, in which capacity he wheedles himself into the confidence of weak-minded people, and by arguments no less specious than false, converts them from their religion and allegiance. He has been in the hands of justice more than once for such practices, but he is a sly dog, and manages matters with so much craft, that hitherto he has escaped for a short imprisonment. As for the general, you may see he has owed his promotion more to his interest than his capacity; and, now that the eyes of the ministry are opened, his friends dead or become inconsiderable, he is struck off the list, and obliged to put up with a yearly pension. In consequence of this reduction, he is become malcontent, and inveighs against the government in all companies, with so little discretion, that I am surprised at the lenity of the administration, in overlooking his insolence, but the truth of the matter is, he owes his safety to his weakness and want of importance. He has seen a little, and but a little, service, and yet, if you will take his word to it, there has not been a great action performed in the field since the Revolution, in which he was not principally concerned. When a story is told of any great general, he immediately matches it with one of himself, though he is often unhappy in his invention, and commits such gross blunders in the detail, that everybody is in pain for him. Caesar, Pompey, and Alexander the Great, are continually in his mouth; and, as he reads a good deal without any judgment to digest it, his ideas are confused, and his harangues as unintelligible as infinite; for, if once he begin, there is no chance of his leaving off speaking while one person remains to yield attention; therefore the only expedient I know, for putting a stop to his loquacity, is to lay hold of some incongruity he has uttered, and demand an explanation; or ask the meaning of some difficult term that he knows by name; this method will effectually put him to silence, if not to flight, as it happened when I inquired about an epaulement. Had he been acquainted with the signification of that word, his triumph would have been intolerable, and we must have quitted the field first, or been worried with impertinence.\u201d\n\nHaving thus gratified my curiosity, the old gentleman began to discover his own, in questions relating to myself, to which I thought proper to return ambiguous answers. \u201cI presume, Sir,\u201d said he, \u201cyou have travelled.\u201d I answered, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI dare say you have found it very expensive,\u201d said he. I replied, \u201cTo be sure, one cannot travel without money.\u201d \u201cThat I know by experience,\u201d said he, \u201cfor I myself take a trip to Bath or Tunbridge every season; and one must pay sauce for what he has on the road, as well in other countries as in this. That\u2019s a pretty stone in your ring\u2014give me leave, sir\u2014the French have attained to a wonderful skill in making compositions of this kind. Why, now, this looks almost as well as a diamond.\u201d \u201cAlmost as well, Sir!\u201d said I, \u201cWhy not altogether? I am sure if you understand anything of jewels, you must perceive, at first sight, that this stone is a real diamond, and that of a very fine water. Take it in your hand and examine it.\u201d He did so with some confusion, and returned it, saying, \u201cI ask your pardon; I see it is a true brilliant of immense value.\u201d I imagined his respect to me increased after this inquiry; therefore to captivate his esteem the more, I told him, I would show him a seal of composition, engraved after a very valuable antique; upon which I pulled out my watch with a rich gold chain, adorned with three seals set in gold, and an opal ring. He viewed each of them with great eagerness, handled the chain, admired the chased case, and observed that the whole must have cost me a vast sum of money. I affected indifference, and replied in a careless manner, \u201cSome trifle of sixty or seventy guineas.\u201d He stared in my face for some time, and then asked if I was an Englishman? I answered in the negative. \u201cYou are from Ireland then, Sir, I presume,\u201d said he. I made the same reply. \u201cOh! perhaps,\u201d said he \u201cyou were born in one of our settlements abroad.\u201d I still answered No. He seemed very much surprised, and said, he was sure I was not a foreigner. I made no reply, but left him upon the tenter-hooks of impatient uncertainty. He could not contain his anxiety, but asked pardon for the liberties he had taken and, to encourage me the more to disclose my situation, displayed his own without reserve. \u201cI am,\u201d said he, \u201ca single man, have a considerable annuity, on which I live according to my inclination, and make the ends of the year meet very comfortably. As I have no estate to leave behind, I am not troubled with the importunate officiousness of relations or legacy hunters, and I consider the world as made for me, not me for the world. It is my maxim, therefore, to enjoy it while I can, and let futurity shift for itself.\u201d\n\nWhile he thus indulged his own talkative vein, and at the same time, no doubt, expected retaliation from me, a young man entered, dressed in black velvet and an enormous tie-wig, with an air in which natural levity and affected solemnity were so jumbled together, that on the whole he appeared a burlesque on all decorum. This ridiculous oddity danced up to the table at which we sat, and, after a thousand grimaces, asked my friend by the name of Mr. Medlar, if we were not engaged upon business. My companion put on a surly countenance, and replied \u201cNo great business, doctor\u2014but however\u2014\u201d \u201cOh! then,\u201d cried the physician; \u201cI must beg your indulgence a little; pray pardon me, gentlemen.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said he, addressing himself to me, \u201cyour most humble servant. I hope you will forgive me, sir\u2014I must beg the favour to sit\u2014sir\u2014sir\u2014I have something of consequence to impart to my friend Mr. Medlar\u2014sir, I hope you will excuse my freedom in whispering, sir,\u201d Before I had time to give this complaisant person my permission, Mr. Medlar cried, \u201cI\u2019ll have no whispering\u2014if you have anything to say to me, speak with an audible voice.\u201d The doctor seemed a little disconcerted at this exclamation, and, turning again to me, made a thousand apologies for pretending to make a mystery of anything, a piece of caution which he said was owing to his ignorance of my connection with Mr. Medlar; but now he understood I was a friend, and would communicate what he had to say in my hearing. He then began, after two or three hems, in this manner: \u201cYou must know, sir, I am just come from dinner at my Lady Flareit\u2019s (then addressing himself to me), a lady of quality, sir, at whose table I have the honour of dining sometimes. There was Lady Stately and my Lady Larum, and Mrs. Dainty, and Miss Biddy Giggler, upon my word, a very good-natured young lady, with a very pretty fortune sir. There was also my Lord Straddle. Sir John Shrug, and Master Billy Chatter, who is actually a very facetious young gentleman. So, sir, her ladyship seeing me excessively fatigued, for she was the last of fifteen patients (people of distinction, sir) whom I had visited this forenoon, insisted upon my staying dinner, though upon my word I protest I had no appetite; however, in compliance with her ladyship\u2019s request, sir, I sat down, and the conversation turning on different subjects, among other things, Mr Chatter asked very earnestly when I saw Mr. Medlar. I told him I had not had the pleasure of seeing you these nineteen hours and a half; for you may remember, sir, it was nearly about that time; I won\u2019t be positive as to a minute.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d says he, \u201cthen I desire you will go to his lodgings immediately after dinner, and see what\u2019s the matter with him, for he must certainly be very bad from having eaten last night such a vast quantity of raw oysters.\u201d The crusty gentleman, who, from the solemnity of his delivery, expected something extraordinary, no sooner heard his conclusion, than he started up in a testy humour, crying, \u201cPshaw, pshaw! D\u2014n your oysters!\u201d and walked away, after a short compliment of, \u201cYour servant sir,\u201d to me. The doctor got up also, saying, \u201cI vow and protest, upon my word, I am actually amazed;\u201d and followed Mr. Medlar to the bar, which was hard by, where he was paying for his coffee: there he whispered so loud that I could overhear, \u201cPray who is this gentleman?\u201d His friend replied hastily, \u201cI might have known that before now, if it had not been for your impertinent intrusion,\u201d\u2014and walked off very much disappointed. The ceremonious physician returned immediately and sat down by me, asking a thousand pardons for leaving me alone: and giving me to understand that what he had communicated to Mr. Medlar at the bar, was an affair of the last importance, that would admit of no delay. He then called for some coffee, and launched out into the virtues of that berry, which, he said, in cold phlegmatic constitutions, like his, dried up the superfluous moisture, and braced the relaxed nerves. He told me it was utterly unknown to the ancients; and derived its name from an Arabian word, which I might easily perceive by the sound and termination. From this topic he transferred his disquisitions to the verb drink, which he affirmed was improperly applied to the taking of coffee, inasmuch as people did not drink, but sip or sipple that liquor; that the genuine meaning of drinking is to quench one\u2019s thirst, or commit a debauch by swallowing wine; that the Latin word, which conveyed the same idea, was bibere or potare, and that of the Greeks pinein or poteein, though he was apt to believe they were differently used on different occasions: for example\u2014to drink a vast quantity, or, as the vulgar express it, to drink an ocean of liquor, was in Latin potare, and in Greek poteein; and, on the other hand, to use it moderately, was bibere and pinein;\u2014that this was only a conjecture of his, which, however, seemed to be supported by the word bibulous, which is particularly applied to the pores of the skin, and can only drink a very small quantity of the circumambient moisture, by reason of the smallness of their diameters;\u2014whereas, from the verb poteein is derived the substantive potamos, which signifies a river, or vast quantity of liquor. I could not help smiling at this learned and important investigation; and, to recommend myself the more to my new acquaintance, whose disposition I was by this time well informed of, I observed that, what he alleged, did not, to the best of my remembrance, appear in the writings of the ancients; for Horace uses the words poto and bibo indifferently for the same purpose, as in the twentieth Ode of his first Book.\n\n\u201cVile potabis modicis sabinum cantharis\u2014\n\u2014Et pr\u0153lo domitam caleno tu bibes uvam.\u201d\n\nThat I had never heard of the verb poteein, but that potamos, potema, and potos, were derived from pino, poso, pepoka, in consequence of which, the Greek poets never use any other word for festal drinking. Homer describes Nestor at his cups in these words,\n\n\u201cNestora d\u2019ouk elathen iache pinonta perempes.\u201d\n\nAnd Anacreon mentions it on the same occasion always in every page.\n\n\u201cPinonti de oinon hedun.\nOtan pino ton oinon.\nOpliz\u2019 ego de pino.\u201d\n\nAnd in a thousand other places. The doctor who doubtless intended by his criticism to give me a high idea of his erudition, was infinitely surprised to find himself schooled by one of my appearance; and after a considerable pause cried, \u201cUpon my word, you are in the right, sir\u2014I find I have not considered this affair with my usual accuracy.\u201d Then, accosting me in Latin, which he spoke very well, the conversation was maintained full two hours, on a variety of subjects, in that language; and indeed he spoke so judiciously, that I was convinced, notwithstanding his whimsical appearance and attention to trifles, that he was a man of extensive knowledge, especially in books; he looked upon me, as I afterwards understood from Mr. Medlar, as a prodigy in learning, and proposed that very night, if I were not engaged, to introduce me to several young gentlemen of fortune and fashion, with whom I had an appointment at the Bedford coffee house.\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nWagtail introduces me to a set of fine Gentlemen with whom I spend the Evening at a Tavern\u2014our Conversation\u2014the Characters of my new Companions\u2014the Doctor is roasted\u2014our Issue of our Debauch\n\nI accepted his offer with pleasure, and we went thither in a hackney coach where I saw a great number of gay figures fluttering about, most of whom spoke to the doctor with great familiarity. Among the rest stood a group of them round the fire whom I immediately knew to be the very persons who had the night before, by their laughing, alarmed my suspicion of the lady who had put herself under my protection. They no sooner perceived me enter with Dr. Wagtail (for that was my companion\u2019s name) than they tittered and whispered one to another, and I was not a little surprised to find that they were the gentlemen to whose acquaintance he designed to recommend me; for, when he observed them together, he told me who they were, and desired to know by what name he should introduce me. I satisfied him in that particular, and he advanced with great gravity, saying, \u201cGentlemen, your most obedient servant:\u2014give me leave to introduce my friend Mr. Random to your society.\u201d Then, turning to me, \u201cMr. Random, this is Mr. Bragwell\u2014Mr. Banter, sir\u2014Mr. Chatter\u2014my friend Mr. Slyboot, and Mr. Ranter sir.\u201d I saluted each of then in order, and when I came to take Mr. Slyboot by the hand, I perceived him thrust his tongue in his cheek, to the no small entertainment of the company; but I did not think proper to take any notice of it on this occasion. Mr. Ranter too (who I afterwards learned was a player) displayed his talents, by mimicking my air, features, and voice, while he returned my compliment: this feat I should not have been so sensible of, had I not seen him behave in the same manner to my friend Wagtail, when he made up to them at first. But for once I let him enjoy the fruits of his dexterity without question or control, resolved however to chastise his insolence at a more convenient opportunity. Mr. Slyboot, guessing I was a stranger, asked if I had been lately in France? and when I answered in the affirmative, inquired if I had seen the Luxembourg Gallery? I told him I had considered it more than once with great attention: upon this a conversion ensued, in which I discovered him to be a painter.\n\nWhile we were discoursing upon the particulars of this famous performance, I overheard Banter ask Dr. Wagtail, where he had picked up this Mr. Random. To which question the physician answered, \u201cUpon my word, a mighty pretty sort of a gentleman\u2014a man of fortune, sir\u2014he has made the grand tour, and seen the best company in Europe, air.\u201d \u201cWhat, he told you so, I suppose?\u201d said the other: \u201cI take him to be neither more nor less than a French valet-de-chambre.\u201d \u201cO barbarous, barbarous!\u201d cried the doctor; \u201cthis is actually, upon my word, altogether unaccountable. I know all his family perfectly well, sir; he is of the Randoms of the north\u2014a very ancient house sir, and a distant relation of mine.\u201d I was extremely nettled at the conjecture of Mr. Banter, and began to entertain a very indifferent opinion of my company in general; but, as I might possibly by their means acquire a more extensive and agreeable acquaintance, I determined to bear these little mortifications as long as I could without injuring the dignity of my character. After having talked for some time on the weather, plays, politics, and other coffee-house subjects, it was proposed that we should spend the evening at a noted tavern in the neighbourhood, whither we repaired in a body.\n\nHaving taken possession of a room, called for French wine, and bespoke supper, the glass went about pretty freely, and the characters of my associates opened upon me more and more. It soon appeared that the doctor was entertained as butt for the painter and player to exercise their wit upon, for the diversion of the company. Mr. Ranter began the game by asking him what was good for a hoarseness, lowness of spirits, and in digestion, for he was troubled with all these complaints to a very great degree. Wagtail immediately undertook to explain the nature of his case, and in a very prolix manner harangued upon prognostics, diagnostics, symptomatics, therapeutics, inanition, and repletion; then calculated the force of the stomach and lungs in their respective operations; ascribed the player\u2019s malady to a disorder in these organs, proceeding from hard drinkings and vociferations, and prescribed a course of stomachics, with abstinence from venery, wine, loud speaking, laughing, singing, coughing, sneezing, or hallooing. \u201cPah, pah!\u201d cried Ranter, interrupting him, \u201cthe remedy is worse than the disease\u2014I wish I knew where to find some tinder water.\u201d \u201cTinder water!\u201d said the doctor; \u201cUpon my word, I don\u2019t apprehend you, Mr. Ranter.\u201d \u201cWater extracted from tinder,\u201d replied the other, \u201ca universal specific for all distempers incident to man. It was invented by a learned German monk, who, for a valuable consideration, imparted the secret to Paracelsus.\u201d \u201cPardon me,\u201d cried the painter, \u201cit was first used by Solomon, as appears by a Greek manuscript in his civil handwriting, lately found at the foot of Mount Lebanon, by a peasant who was digging for potatoes\u2014\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Wagtail, \u201cin all my vast reading, I never met with such a preparation! neither did I know till this minute, that Solomon understood Greek, or that potatoes grew in Palestine.\u201d\n\nHere Banter interposed, saying, he was surprised that Dr. Wagtail should make the least doubt of Solomon\u2019s understanding Greek, when he is represented to us as the wisest and best-educated prince in the world; and as for potatoes, they were transplanted thither from Ireland, in the time of the Crusade, by some knights of that country. \u201cI profess,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cthere is nothing more likely. I would actually give a vast sum for a sight of that manuscript, which must be inestimable; and, if I understood the process, would set about it immediately.\u201d The player assured him the process was very simple\u2014that he must cram a hundred-weight of dry tinder into a glass retort, and, distilling it by the force of animal heat, it would yield half a scruple of insipid water, one drop of which is a full dose. \u201cUpon my integrity!\u201d exclaimed the incredulous doctor, \u201cthis is very amazing and extraordinary! that a caput mortuum should yield any water at all. I must own I have always been an enemy to specifics which I thought inconsistent with the nature of the animal economy; but certainly the authority of Solomon is not to be questioned. I wonder where I shall find a glass retort large enough to contain such a vast quantity of tinder, the consumption of which must, undoubtedly, raise the price of paper, or where shall I find animal heat sufficient even to warm such a mass?\u201d Slyboot informed him, that he might have a retort blown for him as big as a church: and, that the easiest method of raising the vapour by animal heat, would be to place it in the middle of an infirmary for feverish patients, who might be upon mattresses around and in contact with it. He had he sooner pronounced these words, than Wagtail exclaimed in a rapture, \u201cAn admirable expedient, as I hope to be saved! I will positively put it in practice.\u201d\n\nThis simplicity of the physician furnished excellent diversion for the company, who, in their turns, sneered at him in ironical compliments, which his vanity swallowed as the genuine sentiments of their hearts. Mr. Chatter, impatient of so long a silence, now broke out and entertained us with a catalogue of all the people who danced at the last Hampstead assembly, with a most circumstantial account of the dress and ornaments of each, from the lappets of the ladies to the shoe-buckles of the men; concluding with telling Bragwell, that his mistress Melinda was there, and seemed to miss him: and soliciting his company at the next occasion of that kind.\n\n\u201cNo, d\u2014mm,\u201d said Bragwell, \u201cI have something else to mind than dangling after a parcel of giddy-headed girls; besides, you know my temper is so unruly, that I am apt to involve myself in scrapes when a woman is concerned. The last time I was there, I had an affair with Tom Trippit.\u201d \u201cOh! I remember that!\u201d cried Banter; \u201cYou lugged out before the ladies; and I commend you for so doing, because you had an opportunity of showing your manhood without running any risk.\u201d \u201cRisk!\u201d said the other with a fierce countenance, \u201cd\u2014n my blood! I fear no risks. I an\u2019t afraid of lugging out against any man that wears a head, d\u2014me! \u2019Tis well known that I have drawn blood more than once, and lost some too; but what does that signify?\u201d The player begged this champion to employ him as his second the next time he intended to kill, for he wanted to see a man die of a stab, that he might know how to act such an art the more naturally on the stage. \u201cDie!\u201d replied the hero: \u201cNo, by G\u2014! I know better things than to incur the verdict of a Middlesex jury\u2014I should look upon my fencing-master to be an ignorant son of a b\u2014h, if he had not taught me to prick any of my antagonist\u2019s body that I please to disable.\u201d \u201cOho!\u201d cried Slyboot, \u201cif that be the case, I have a favour to ask. You must know I am employed to paint a Jesus on the cross; and my purpose is to represent him at that point of time when the spear is thrust into his side. Now I should be glad if you would, in my presence, pink some impertinent fellow into convulsions, without endangering his life, that I may have an opportunity of taking a good clever agony from nature: the doctor will direct you where to enter and how far to go, but pray let it be as near the left side as possible.\u201d Wagtail, who took this proposal seriously, observed, that it would be a very difficult matter to penetrate into the left side of the thorax without hurting the heart, and in consequence killing the patient; but he believed it was possible for a man of a very nice hand and exact knowledge of anatomy, to wound the diaphragma somewhere about the skirts, which might induce a singultus, without being attended with death: that he was ready to demonstrate the insertion of that muscle to Mr. Bragwell; but desired to have no concern with the experiment, which might essentially prejudice his reputation, in case of a miscarriage. Bragwell was as much imposed upon by the painter\u2019s waggery as the doctor, and declined engaging in the affair, saying he held a very great regard for Mr. Slyboot, but had laid it down as a maxim, never to fight except when his honour was engaged. A thousand jokes of this kind were uttered; the wine circulated, supper was served in, we ate heartily, returned to the bottle, Bragwell became noisy and troublesome, Banter grew more and more severe, Ranter rehearsed, Slyboot made faces at the whole company, I sang French catches, and Chatter kissed me with great affection; while the doctor, with a wofull countenance, sat silent like a disciple of Pythagoras. At length, it was proposed by Bragwell, that we should scour the hundreds, sweat the constable, maul the watch, and then reel soberly to bed.\n\nWhile we deliberated upon this expedition, the waiter came into the room, and asked for Doctor Wagtail: when he understood he was present, he told him there was a lady below to inquire for him, at which message the physician started from his melancholy contemplation, and, with a look of extreme confusion, assured the company he could not possibly be the person wanted, for he had no connection with any lady whatever, and bade the drawer tell her so. \u201cFor shame!\u201d cried Banter; \u201cwould you be so impolite as to refuse a lady a hearing? perhaps she comes for a consultation. It must be some extraordinary affair that brings a lady to a tavern at this time of night. Mr. Ranter, pray do the doctor\u2019s base-mains to the lady, and squire her hither.\u201d The player immediately staggered out, and returned, leading in with much ceremony, a tall strapping wench, whose appearance proclaimed her occupation. We received her with the utmost solemnity, and with a good deal of entreaty she was persuaded to sit, when a profound silence ensued, during which she fixed her eyes, with a disconsolate look, upon the doctor, who was utterly confounded at her behaviour, and returned her melancholy fourfold; at length, after a good many piteous sighs, she wiped her eyes, and accosted him thus: \u201cWhat! not one word of comfort? Will nothing soften that stony heart of thine? Not all my tears! not all my affliction! not the inevitable ruin thou hast brought upon me! Where are thy vows, thou faithless, perjured man? Hast thou no honour\u2014no conscience\u2014no remorse for thy perfidious conduct towards me? Answer me, wilt thou at last do me justice, or must I have recourse to heaven or hell for my revenge?\u201d If poor Wagtail was amazed before she spoke, what must his confusion be on hearing this address! His natural paleness changed into a ghastly clay colour, his eyes rolled, his lip trembled, and he answered in an accent not to be described, \u201cUpon my word, honour, and salvation, madam, you are actually mistaken in my person. I have a most particular veneration for your sex, and, am actually incapable of injuring any lady in the smallest degree, madam; besides, madam, to the best of my recollection, I never had the honour of seeing you before, as I hope to be saved, madam!\u201d \u201cHow, traitor!\u201d cried she, \u201cdost thou disown me then? Mistaken! no, too well I know that fair bewitching face! too well I know that false enchanting tongue! Alas! gentlemen, since the villain compels me by his unkindness, to expose myself and him, know that this betrayer, under the specious pretence of honourable addresses, won my heart, and taking advantage of his conquest, robbed me of my virgin treasure, and afterwards abandoned me to my fate! I am now four months gone with child by him, turned out of doors by my relations, and left a prey to misery and want! Yes, thou barbarian,\u201d said she, turning to Wagtail, \u201cthou tiger, thou succubus! too well thou knowest my situation. But I will tear out thy faithless heart, and deliver the world from such a monster.\u201d So saying, she sprang forward at the doctor, who with incredible agility, jumped over the table, and ran behind Bragwell, while the rest of us endeavoured to appease the furious heroine. Although everybody in the company affected the utmost surprise, I could easily perceive it was a scheme concerted among them to produce diversion at the doctor\u2019s expense, and being under no concern about the consequence, I entered into the confederacy, and enjoyed the distress of Wagtail, who with tears in his eyes begged the protection of the company, declaring himself as innocent of the crime laid to his charge as the foetus in utero; and hinting at the same time, that nature had not put it in his power to be guilty of such a trespass. \u201cNature!\u201d cried the lady, \u201cthere was no nature in the case; he abused me by the help of charms and spells; else how is it possible that any woman could have listened to the addresses of such a scarecrow? Were these owlish eyes made for ogling; that carrion complexion to be admired; or that mouth, like a horse-shoe, to be kissed? No, no, you owe your success to your philtres, to your drugs and incantations; and not to your natural talents, which are, in every respect, mean and contemptible.\u201d\n\nThe doctor thought he had got an opportunity of vindicating himself effectually; and desired the complainant to compose herself but for half-an-hour, in which he undertook to prove the absurdity of believing in the power of incantations, which were only idle dreams of ignorance and superstition. He accordingly pronounced a very learned discourse upon the nature of ideas, the power and independence of the mind, the properties of stimulating medicines, the difference between a proneness to venery, which many simples would create, and a passion limited to one object, which can only be the result of sense and reflection; and concluded with a pathetic remonstrance, setting forth his unhappiness in being persecuted with the resentment of a lady whom he had never injured, nor even seen before that occasion, and whose faculties were, in all likelihood, so much impaired by her misfortunes that an innocent person was in danger of being ruined by her disorder. He had no sooner finished his harangue, than the forlorn princess renewed her lamentations, and cautioned the company against his eloquence, which, she said, was able to bias the most impartial bench in Christendom. Ranter advised him to espouse her immediately, as the only means to save his reputation, and offered to accompany him to the Fleet for that purpose; but Slyboot proposed that a father should be purchased for the child, and a comfortable alimony settled on the mother. Ranter promised to adopt the infant gratis. Wagtail was ready to worship him for his generosity, and, though he persisted in protesting his innocence, condescended to everything rather than his unblemished character should be called into question. The lady rejected the proposal, and insisted on matrimony. Bragwell took up the cudgels for the doctor, and undertook to rid him of her importunity for half-a-guinea; upon which Wagtail, with great eagerness, pulled out his purse, and put it into the hand of his friend, who, taking half a piece out of it, gave it to the plaintiff, and bade her thank God for her good fortune. When she had received this bounty, she affected to weep, and begged, since the physician had renounced her, he would at least vouchsafe her a parting kiss; this he was prevailed upon to grant with great reluctance, and went up with his usual solemnity to salute her, when she laid hold of his cheek with her teeth, and held fast, while he roared with anguish, to the unspeakable diversion of all present. When she thought proper to release him, she dropped a low courtesy to the company, and quitted the room, leaving the doctor in the utmost horror, not so much on account of the pain, as the apprehension of the consequence of the bite; for, by this time, he was convinced of her being mad. Banter prescribed the actual cautery, and put the poker in the fire to be heated, in order to sear the place. The player was of opinion that Bragwell should scoop out the part affected with the point of his sword; but the painter prevented both these dreadful operations by recommending a balsam he had in his pocket, which never failed to cure the bite of a mad dog; so saying, he pulled out a small bladder of black paint, with which he instantly anointed not only the sore, but the greatest part of the patient\u2019s face, and left it in a frightful condition. In short, the poor creature was so harassed with fear and vexation, that I pitied him extremely, and sent him home in a chair, contrary to the inclination of everybody present.\n\nThis freedom of mine gave umbrage to Bragwell, who testified his displeasure by swearing a few threats, without making any application; which, being perceived by Slyboot, who sat by me, he, with a view of promoting a quarrel, whispered to me, that he thought Bragwell used me very ill, but every man was the best judge of his own affairs. I answered aloud, that I would neither suffer Mr. Bragwell nor him to use me ill with impunity; and that I stood in no need of his counsel in regard to the regulation of my conduct. He thought proper to ask a thousand pardons, and assure me he meant no offence; while Bragwell feigned himself asleep, that he might not be obliged to take notice of what passed. But the player, who had more animal spirits and less discretion than Slyboot, unwilling to let the affair rest where he had dropped it, jogged Mr. Bragwell and told him softly that I had called him names, and threatened to cudgel him. This particular I understood by his starting, up and crying, \u201cBlood and wounds, you lie! No man durst treat me so ignominiously. Mr. Random, did you call me names, and threaten to drub me?\u201d I denied the imputation, and proposed to punish the scoundrel who endeavoured to foment disturbance in the company. Bragwell signified his approbation, and drew his sword; I did the same, and accosted the actor in these words: \u201cLookee, Mr. Ranter; I know you possess all the mimicry and mischievous qualities of an ape, because I have observed you put them all in practice more than once to-night, on me and others; now I want to see if you resemble one in nimbleness also; therefore, I desire you leap over this sword without hesitation.\u201d So saying, I held it parallel to the horizon, at the distance of about three feet from the floor, and called, \u201cOnce-twice-thrice\u2014and away!\u201d but, instead of complying with my demand, he snatched his hat and hanger, and, assuming the looks, swagger, and phrase of Pistol, burst out into the following exclamation, \u201cHa! must I then perform inglorious prank of sylvan ape in mountain forest caught! Death rock me asleep, abridge my doleful days, and lay my head in fury\u2019s lap\u2014Have we not Hiren here?\u201d This buffoonery did not answer his expectation, for, by this time, the company was bent on seeing him in a new character. Mr. Banter desired me to hold my sword a foot or two higher, that he might have the better opportunity of exerting himself. The painter told him, if he performed well, he would recommend him as a vaulter to the proprietors of Sadler\u2019s Wells; and Bragwell crying, \u201cLeap for the King!\u201d applied the point of his sword to the player\u2019s posteriors with such success, that he sprang over in a trice, and, finding the door unguarded, vanished in a twinkling; glad, no doubt, of having paid his share of the reckoning so easily.\n\nIt being now near two o\u2019clock in the morning, we discharged the bill, and sallied out into the street. The painter slunk away without taking his leave. Billy Chatter, being unable to speak or stand, was sent to a bagnio; and Banter and I accompanied Bragwell to Moll King\u2019s coffee-house, where after he had kicked half a dozen hungry whores, we left him asleep on a bench, and directed our course towards Charing-cross, near which place both he and I lodged.\n\nThe natural dryness of my companion being overcome by liquor, he honoured me by the way with many compliments and professions, of friendship, for which I made suitable acknowledgments, and told him I thought myself happy in having, by my behaviour, removed the unfavourable opinion he entertained of me at first sight. He was surprised at this declaration, and begged me to explain myself; upon which I mentioned what I had overheard him say of me to Wagtail in the coffee-house. He laughed, and made an apology for his freedom, assuring me, that my appearance had very much prepossessed him in my favour; and what he said was only intended as a joke on the doctor\u2019s solemnity. I was highly pleased at being undeceived in this particular, and not a little proud of the good opinion of this wit, who shook me by the hand at parting, and promised to meet me the next day at the ordinary.\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\nStrap communicates to me a conquest he had made of a Chandler\u2019s Widow\u2014finds himself miserably mistaken\u2014I go to the Opera\u2014admire Melinda\u2014am cautioned by Banter\u2014go to the Assembly at Hampstead\u2014dance with that young lady\u2014receive an insolent message from Bragwell, whose mettle is soon cooled\u2014am in favour with my Mistress, whom I visit next day, and am bubbled out of eighteen guineas at cards\u2014Strap triumphs at my success, but is astonished at my expense\u2014Banter comes to my lodging, is very sarcastic at my expense, and borrows five guineas from me, as a proof of his friendship\n\nIn the morning, before I got up, Strap came into my chamber, and, finding me awake, hemmed several times, scratched his head, cast his eyes upon the ground, and, with a very foolish kind of simper upon his face gave me to understand he had something to communicate. \u201cBy your countenance,\u201d said I, \u201cI expect to hear good tidings.\u201d \u201cIndifferently,\u201d replied he, tittering, \u201cthat is, hereafter as it shall be. You must know, I have some thoughts of altering my condition.\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d cried I, astonished, \u201ca matrimonial scheme? O rare Strap! thou hast got the heels of me at last.\u201d \u201cN\u2014no less, I assure you,\u201d said he, bursting into a laugh of self-approbation: \u201ca tallow chandler\u2019s widow that lives hard by, has taken a liking to me, a fine jolly dame, as plump as a partridge. She has a well-furnished house, a brisk trade, and a good deal of the ready. I may have her for the asking. She told a friend of mine, a brother footman, that she would take me out of a stinking clout. But I refused to give my final answer, till I knew your opinion of the matter.\u201d I congratulated Monsieur d\u2019Estrapes upon his conquest, and approved of the scheme, provided he could be assured of those circumstances of her fortune; but advised him to do nothing rashly, and give me an opportunity of seeing the lady before matters should be brought to a conclusion. He assured me he would do nothing without my consent and approbation, and that very morning, while I was at breakfast, introduce his inamorata to my acquaintance. She was a short thick woman, about the age of thirty-six, and had a particular prominence of belly, which I perceived at first sight, not without some suspicion of foul play. I desired her, however, to sit, and treated her with a dish of tea; the discourse turning on the good qualities of Strap, whom I represented as a prodigy of sobriety, industry and virtue. When she took her leave, he followed her to the door, and returned licking his lips, and asking if I did not think she was a luscious creature. I made no mystery of my apprehension, but declared my sentiments of her without reserve; at which he was not surprised, telling me he had observed the same symptom, but was informed by his friend that she was only livergrown and would in few months be as small in the waist as ever. \u201cYes,\u201d said I, \u201ca few weeks, I believe, will do the business. In short, Strap, it is my opinion, that you are egregiously imposed upon; and that this friend is no other than a rascal who wants to palm his trull upon you for a wife, that he may at once deliver himself from the importunities of the mother and the expense of her bantling; for which reason I would not have you trust implicitly to the report he makes of her wealth, which is inconsistent with his behaviour, nor run your head precipitately into a noose, that you may afterwards wish exchanged for the hangman\u2019s.\u201d He seemed very much startled at my insinuation, and promised to look twice before he leaped; saying, with some heat, \u201cOdds, if I find his intention is to betray me, we shall see which of us is the better man.\u201d My prediction was verified in less than a fortnight, her great belly producing an infant, to the unspeakable amazement of Strap, who was before this happened, inclinable to believe I had refined a little too much in my penetration. His false friend disappeared; and a few days after an execution was issued against her goods and household furniture, which were seized by the creditors.\n\nMeanwhile I met my friend Banter at the ordinary, and in the evening went to the Opera with him and Mr Chatter, who pointed out Melinda in one of the boxes, and offered to introduce me to her, observing at the same time, that she was a reigning toast worth ten thousand pounds. This piece of information made my heart bound with joy, and I discovered great eagerness to accept the proposal; upon which he assured me I should dance with her at the next assembly, if he had any influence in that quarter: so saying, he went round, spoke to her some minutes, and, as I imagined, pointed at me; then returning, told me, to my inexpressible pleasure, that I might depend upon what he had promised, for she was now engaged as my partner. Banter in a whisper, gave me to understand that she was an incorrigible coquette, who would grant the same favour to any young fellow in England of a tolerable appearance, merely to engage him among the herd of her admirers, that she might have the pleasure of seeing them daily increase; that she was of a cold insensible disposition, dead to every passion but vanity, and so blind to merit, that he would lay any wager the wealthiest fool would carry her at last. I attributed a good deal of this intelligence to the satirical turn of my friend, or resentment for having himself suffered a rebuff from the lady in question, and, at any rate, trusted so much to my own accomplishments as to believe no woman could resist the ardour of my addresses.\n\nFull of this confidence I repaired to Hampstead in company with Billy Chatter, my Lord Hobble, and Doctor Wagtail. There I saw a very brilliant assembly, before whom I had the honour to walk a minuet with Melinda, who charmed me with her frank manner and easiness of behaviour. Before the country dances began, I received a message by a person I did not know from Bragwell, who was present, importing that nobody who knew him presumed to dance with Melinda while he was there in person, that I would do well to relinquish her without noise, because he had a mind to lead up a country dance with her. This extraordinary intimation, which was delivered in the lady\u2019s hearing, did not at all discompose me, who, by this time, was pretty well acquainted with the character of my rival. I therefore, without the least symptom of concern bade the gentleman tell Mr. Bragwell, that since I was so happy as to obtain the lady\u2019s consent, I should not be solicitous about his; and desired the bearer himself to bring me no such impertinent messages for the future. Melinda, affected a sort of confusion, and pretended to wonder that Mr. Bragwell should give himself such liberties with regard to her, who had no manner of connection with the fellow. I laid hold of this opportunity to display my valour, and offered to call him to an account for his insolence, a proposal which she absolutely refused, under pretence of consulting my safety; though I could perceive, by the sparkling of her eyes, that she would not have thought herself affronted by being the subject of a duel. I was by no means pleased with this discovery of her thoughts, which not only argued the most unjustifiable vanity, but likewise the most barbarous indifference; however, I was allured by her fortune, and resolved to gratify her pride, in making her the occasion of a public quarrel between me and Bragwell, who, I was pretty certain, would never drive matters to a dangerous extremity.\n\nWhile we danced together, I observed this formidable rival at one end of the room, encircled with a cluster of beaux, to whom he talked with great vehemence, casting many big looks at me from time to time. I guessed the subject of his discourse, and as soon as I had handed my partner to her seat, strutted up to the place where he stood, and, cocking my hat in his face, demanded aloud, if he had anything to say to me. He answered with a sullen tone, \u201cNothing, at present, sir;\u201d and turned about upon his heel. \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cyou know where I am to be found at any time.\u201d His companions stared at one another, and I returned to the lady, whose features brightened at my approach, and immediately a whisper ran through the whole room; after which so many eyes were turned upon me that I was ready to sink with confusion. When the ball broke up, I led her to her coach, and, like a true French gallant, would have got up behind it, in order to protect her from violence on the road, but she absolutely refused my offer, and expressed her concern that there was not an empty seat for me within the vehicle.\n\nNext day, in the afternoon, I waited on her at her lodgings, by permission, in company with Chatter, and was very civilly received by her mother, with whom she lived. There were a good many fashionable people present, chiefly young fellows, and immediately after tea, a couple of card tables were set, at one of which I had the honour to play with Melinda, who in less than three hours, made shift to plunder me of eight guineas. I was well enough content to lose a little money with a good grace, that I might have an opportunity in the meantime to say soft things, which are still most welcome when attended with good luck; but I was by no means satisfied of her fair play, a circumstance that shocked me not a little, and greatly impaired my opinion of her disinterestedness and delicacy. However, I was resolved to profit by this behaviour, and treat her in my turn with less ceremony; accordingly, I laid close siege to her, and, finding her not at all disgusted with the gross incense I offered, that very night made a declaration of love in plain terms. She received my addresses with great gaiety, and pretended to laugh them off, but at the same time treated me with such particular complacency that I was persuaded I had made a conquest of her heart, and concluded myself the happiest man alive. Elevated with these flattering ideas, I sat down again to cards after supper, and with great cheerfulness suffered myself to be cheated of ten guineas more.\n\nIt was late before I took my leave, after being favoured with a general invitation; and, when I got into bed, the adventures of the day hindered me from sleeping. Sometimes I pleased myself with the hopes of possessing a fine woman with ten thousand pounds; then I would ruminate on the character I had heard of her from Banter, and compare it with the circumstances of her conduct towards me, which seemed to bear too great a resemblance to the picture he had drawn. This introduced a melancholy reflection on the expense I had undergone, and the smallness of my funds to support it, which, by-the-by, were none of my own. In short, I found myself involved in doubts and perplexities, that kept me awake the greatest part of the night.\n"},{title:"The Blue Castle",author:"L. M. Montgomery",gender:"Female",text:"f it had not rained on a certain May morning Valancy Stirling\u2019s whole life would have been entirely different. She would have gone, with the rest of her clan, to Aunt Wellington\u2019s engagement picnic and Dr. Trent would have gone to Montreal. But it did rain and you shall hear what happened to her because of it.\n\nValancy wakened early, in the lifeless, hopeless hour just preceding dawn. She had not slept very well. One does not sleep well, sometimes, when one is twenty-nine on the morrow, and unmarried, in a community and connection where the unmarried are simply those who have failed to get a man.\n\nDeerwood and the Stirlings had long since relegated Valancy to hopeless old maidenhood. But Valancy herself had never quite relinquished a certain pitiful, shamed, little hope that Romance would come her way yet\u2014never, until this wet, horrible morning, when she wakened to the fact that she was twenty-nine and unsought by any man.\n\nAy, there lay the sting. Valancy did not mind so much being an old maid. After all, she thought, being an old maid couldn\u2019t possibly be as dreadful as being married to an Uncle Wellington or an Uncle Benjamin, or even an Uncle Herbert. What hurt her was that she had never had a chance to be anything but an old maid. No man had ever desired her.\n\nThe tears came into her eyes as she lay there alone in the faintly greying darkness. She dared not let herself cry as hard as she wanted to, for two reasons. She was afraid that crying might bring on another attack of that pain around the heart. She had had a spell of it after she had got into bed\u2014rather worse than any she had had yet. And she was afraid her mother would notice her red eyes at breakfast and keep at her with minute, persistent, mosquito-like questions regarding the cause thereof.\n\n\u201cSuppose,\u201d thought Valancy with a ghastly grin, \u201cI answered with the plain truth, \u2018I am crying because I cannot get married.\u2019 How horrified Mother would be\u2014though she is ashamed every day of her life of her old maid daughter.\u201d\n\nBut of course appearances should be kept up. \u201cIt is not,\u201d Valancy could hear her mother\u2019s prim, dictatorial voice asserting, \u201cit is not maidenly to think about men.\u201d\n\nThe thought of her mother\u2019s expression made Valancy laugh\u2014for she had a sense of humour nobody in her clan suspected. For that matter, there were a good many things about Valancy that nobody suspected. But her laughter was very superficial and presently she lay there, a huddled, futile little figure, listening to the rain pouring down outside and watching, with a sick distaste, the chill, merciless light creeping into her ugly, sordid room.\n\nShe knew the ugliness of that room by heart\u2014knew it and hated it. The yellow-painted floor, with one hideous, \u201chooked\u201d rug by the bed, with a grotesque, \u201chooked\u201d dog on it, always grinning at her when she awoke; the faded, dark-red paper; the ceiling discoloured by old leaks and crossed by cracks; the narrow, pinched little washstand; the brown-paper lambrequin with purple roses on it; the spotted old looking-glass with the crack across it, propped up on the inadequate dressing-table; the jar of ancient potpourri made by her mother in her mythical honeymoon; the shell-covered box, with one burst corner, which Cousin Stickles had made in her equally mythical girlhood; the beaded pincushion with half its bead fringe gone; the one stiff, yellow chair; the faded old motto, \u201cGone but not forgotten,\u201d worked in coloured yarns about Great-grand-mother Stirling\u2019s grim old face; the old photographs of ancient relatives long banished from the rooms below. There were only two pictures that were not of relatives. One, an old chromo of a puppy sitting on a rainy doorstep. That picture always made Valancy unhappy. That forlorn little dog crouched on the doorstep in the driving rain! Why didn\u2019t some one open the door and let him in? The other picture was a faded, passe-partouted engraving of Queen Louise coming down a stairway, which Aunt Wellington had lavishly given her on her tenth birthday. For nineteen years she had looked at it and hated it, beautiful, smug, self-satisfied Queen Louise. But she never dared destroy it or remove it. Mother and Cousin Stickles would have been aghast, or, as Valancy irreverently expressed it in her thoughts, would have had a fit.\n\nEvery room in the house was ugly, of course. But downstairs appearances were kept up somewhat. There was no money for rooms nobody ever saw. Valancy sometimes felt that she could have done something for her room herself, even without money, if she were permitted. But her mother had negatived every timid suggestion and Valancy did not persist. Valancy never persisted. She was afraid to. Her mother could not brook opposition. Mrs. Stirling would sulk for days if offended, with the airs of an insulted duchess.\n\nThe only thing Valancy liked about her room was that she could be alone there at night to cry if she wanted to.\n\nBut, after all, what did it matter if a room, which you used for nothing except sleeping and dressing in, were ugly? Valancy was never permitted to stay alone in her room for any other purpose. People who wanted to be alone, so Mrs. Frederick Stirling and Cousin Stickles believed, could only want to be alone for some sinister purpose. But her room in the Blue Castle was everything a room should be.\n\nValancy, so cowed and subdued and overridden and snubbed in real life, was wont to let herself go rather splendidly in her day-dreams. Nobody in the Stirling clan, or its ramifications, suspected this, least of all her mother and Cousin Stickles. They never knew that Valancy had two homes\u2014the ugly red brick box of a home, on Elm Street, and the Blue Castle in Spain. Valancy had lived spiritually in the Blue Castle ever since she could remember. She had been a very tiny child when she found herself possessed of it. Always, when she shut her eyes, she could see it plainly, with its turrets and banners on the pine-clad mountain height, wrapped in its faint, blue loveliness, against the sunset skies of a fair and unknown land. Everything wonderful and beautiful was in that castle. Jewels that queens might have worn; robes of moonlight and fire; couches of roses and gold; long flights of shallow marble steps, with great, white urns, and with slender, mist-clad maidens going up and down them; courts, marble-pillared, where shimmering fountains fell and nightingales sang among the myrtles; halls of mirrors that reflected only handsome knights and lovely women\u2014herself the loveliest of all, for whose glance men died. All that supported her through the boredom of her days was the hope of going on a dream spree at night. Most, if not all, of the Stirlings would have died of horror if they had known half the things Valancy did in her Blue Castle.\n\nFor one thing she had quite a few lovers in it. Oh, only one at a time. One who wooed her with all the romantic ardour of the age of chivalry and won her after long devotion and many deeds of derring-do, and was wedded to her with pomp and circumstance in the great, banner-hung chapel of the Blue Castle.\n\nAt twelve, this lover was a fair lad with golden curls and heavenly blue eyes. At fifteen, he was tall and dark and pale, but still necessarily handsome. At twenty, he was ascetic, dreamy, spiritual. At twenty-five, he had a clean-cut jaw, slightly grim, and a face strong and rugged rather than handsome. Valancy never grew older than twenty-five in her Blue Castle, but recently\u2014very recently\u2014her hero had had reddish, tawny hair, a twisted smile and a mysterious past.\n\nI don\u2019t say Valancy deliberately murdered these lovers as she outgrew them. One simply faded away as another came. Things are very convenient in this respect in Blue Castles.\n\nBut, on this morning of her day of fate, Valancy could not find the key of her Blue Castle. Reality pressed on her too hardly, barking at her heels like a maddening little dog. She was twenty-nine, lonely, undesired, ill-favoured\u2014the only homely girl in a handsome clan, with no past and no future. As far as she could look back, life was drab and colourless, with not one single crimson or purple spot anywhere. As far as she could look forward it seemed certain to be just the same until she was nothing but a solitary, little withered leaf clinging to a wintry bough. The moment when a woman realises that she has nothing to live for\u2014neither love, duty, purpose nor hope\u2014holds for her the bitterness of death.\n\n\u201cAnd I just have to go on living because I can\u2019t stop. I may have to live eighty years,\u201d thought Valancy, in a kind of panic. \u201cWe\u2019re all horribly long-lived. It sickens me to think of it.\u201d\n\nShe was glad it was raining\u2014or rather, she was drearily satisfied that it was raining. There would be no picnic that day. This annual picnic, whereby Aunt and Uncle Wellington\u2014one always thought of them in that succession\u2014inevitably celebrated their engagement at a picnic thirty years before, had been, of late years, a veritable nightmare to Valancy. By an impish coincidence it was the same day as her birthday and, after she had passed twenty-five, nobody let her forget it.\n\nMuch as she hated going to the picnic, it would never have occurred to her to rebel against it. There seemed to be nothing of the revolutionary in her nature. And she knew exactly what every one would say to her at the picnic. Uncle Wellington, whom she disliked and despised even though he had fulfilled the highest Stirling aspiration, \u201cmarrying money,\u201d would say to her in a pig\u2019s whisper, \u201cNot thinking of getting married yet, my dear?\u201d and then go off into the bellow of laughter with which he invariably concluded his dull remarks. Aunt Wellington, of whom Valancy stood in abject awe, would tell her about Olive\u2019s new chiffon dress and Cecil\u2019s last devoted letter. Valancy would have to look as pleased and interested as if the dress and letter had been hers or else Aunt Wellington would be offended. And Valancy had long ago decided that she would rather offend God than Aunt Wellington, because God might forgive her but Aunt Wellington never would.\n\nAunt Alberta, enormously fat, with an amiable habit of always referring to her husband as \u201che,\u201d as if he were the only male creature in the world, who could never forget that she had been a great beauty in her youth, would condole with Valancy on her sallow skin\u2014\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why all the girls of today are so sunburned. When I was a girl my skin was roses and cream. I was counted the prettiest girl in Canada, my dear.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Uncle Herbert wouldn\u2019t say anything\u2014or perhaps he would remark jocularly, \u201cHow fat you\u2019re getting, Doss!\u201d And then everybody would laugh over the excessively humorous idea of poor, scrawny little Doss getting fat.\n\nHandsome, solemn Uncle James, whom Valancy disliked but respected because he was reputed to be very clever and was therefore the clan oracle\u2014brains being none too plentiful in the Stirling connection\u2014would probably remark with the owl-like sarcasm that had won him his reputation, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re busy with your hope-chest these days?\u201d\n\nAnd Uncle Benjamin would ask some of his abominable conundrums, between wheezy chuckles, and answer them himself.\n\n\u201cWhat is the difference between Doss and a mouse?\n\n\u201cThe mouse wishes to harm the cheese and Doss wishes to charm the he\u2019s.\u201d\n\nValancy had heard him ask that riddle fifty times and every time she wanted to throw something at him. But she never did. In the first place, the Stirlings simply did not throw things; in the second place, Uncle Benjamin was a wealthy and childless old widower and Valancy had been brought up in the fear and admonition of his money. If she offended him he would cut her out of his will\u2014supposing she were in it. Valancy did not want to be cut out of Uncle Benjamin\u2019s will. She had been poor all her life and knew the galling bitterness of it. So she endured his riddles and even smiled tortured little smiles over them.\n\nAunt Isabel, downright and disagreeable as an east wind, would criticise her in some way\u2014Valancy could not predict just how, for Aunt Isabel never repeated a criticism\u2014she found something new with which to jab you every time. Aunt Isabel prided herself on saying what she thought, but didn\u2019t like it so well when other people said what they thought to her. Valancy never said what she thought.\n\nCousin Georgiana\u2014named after her great-great-grand-mother, who had been named after George the Fourth\u2014would recount dolorously the names of all relatives and friends who had died since the last picnic and wonder \u201cwhich of us will be the first to go next.\u201d\n\nOppressively competent, Aunt Mildred would talk endlessly of her husband and her odious prodigies of babies to Valancy, because Valancy would be the only one she could find to put up with it. For the same reason, Cousin Gladys\u2014really First Cousin Gladys once removed, according to the strict way in which the Stirlings tabulated relationship\u2014a tall, thin lady who admitted she had a sensitive disposition, would describe minutely the tortures of her neuritis. And Olive, the wonder girl of the whole Stirling clan, who had everything Valancy had not\u2014beauty, popularity, love,\u2014would show off her beauty and presume on her popularity and flaunt her diamond insignia of love in Valancy\u2019s dazzled, envious eyes.\n\nThere would be none of all this today. And there would be no packing up of teaspoons. The packing up was always left for Valancy and Cousin Stickles. And once, six years ago, a silver teaspoon from Aunt Wellington\u2019s wedding set had been lost. Valancy never heard the last of that silver teaspoon. Its ghost appeared Banquo-like at every subsequent family feast.\n\nOh, yes, Valancy knew exactly what the picnic would be like and she blessed the rain that had saved her from it. There would be no picnic this year. If Aunt Wellington could not celebrate on the sacred day itself she would have no celebration at all. Thank whatever gods there were for that.\n\nSince there would be no picnic, Valancy made up her mind that, if the rain held up in the afternoon, she would go up to the library and get another of John Foster\u2019s books. Valancy was never allowed to read novels, but John Foster\u2019s books were not novels. They were \u201cnature books\u201d\u2014so the librarian told Mrs. Frederick Stirling\u2014\u201call about the woods and birds and bugs and things like that, you know.\u201d So Valancy was allowed to read them\u2014under protest, for it was only too evident that she enjoyed them too much. It was permissible, even laudable, to read to improve your mind and your religion, but a book that was enjoyable was dangerous. Valancy did not know whether her mind was being improved or not; but she felt vaguely that if she had come across John Foster\u2019s books years ago life might have been a different thing for her. They seemed to her to yield glimpses of a world into which she might once have entered, though the door was forever barred to her now. It was only within the last year that John Foster\u2019s books had been in the Deerwood library, though the librarian told Valancy that he had been a well-known writer for several years.\n\n\u201cWhere does he live?\u201d Valancy had asked.\n\n\u201cNobody knows. From his books he must be a Canadian, but no more information can be had. His publishers won\u2019t say a word. Quite likely John Foster is a nom de plume. His books are so popular we can\u2019t keep them in at all, though I really can\u2019t see what people find in them to rave over.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re wonderful,\u201d said Valancy, timidly.\n\n\u201cOh\u2014well\u2014\u201d Miss Clarkson smiled in a patronising fashion that relegated Valancy\u2019s opinions to limbo, \u201cI can\u2019t say I care much for bugs myself. But certainly Foster seems to know all there is to know about them.\u201d\n\nValancy didn\u2019t know whether she cared much for bugs either. It was not John Foster\u2019s uncanny knowledge of wild creatures and insect life that enthralled her. She could hardly say what it was\u2014some tantalising lure of a mystery never revealed\u2014some hint of a great secret just a little further on\u2014some faint, elusive echo of lovely, forgotten things\u2014John Foster\u2019s magic was indefinable.\n\nYes, she would get a new Foster book. It was a month since she had Thistle Harvest, so surely Mother could not object. Valancy had read it four times\u2014she knew whole passages off by heart.\n\nAnd\u2014she almost thought she would go and see Dr. Trent about that queer pain around the heart. It had come rather often lately, and the palpitations were becoming annoying, not to speak of an occasional dizzy moment and a queer shortness of breath. But could she go to see him without telling any one? It was a most daring thought. None of the Stirlings ever consulted a doctor without holding a family council and getting Uncle James\u2019 approval. Then, they went to Dr. Ambrose Marsh of Port Lawrence, who had married Second Cousin Adelaide Stirling.\n\nBut Valancy disliked Dr. Ambrose Marsh. And, besides, she could not get to Port Lawrence, fifteen miles away, without being taken there. She did not want any one to know about her heart. There would be such a fuss made and every member of the family would come down and talk it over and advise her and caution her and warn her and tell her horrible tales of great-aunts and cousins forty times removed who had been \u201cjust like that\u201d and \u201cdropped dead without a moment\u2019s warning, my dear.\u201d\n\nAunt Isabel would remember that she had always said Doss looked like a girl who would have heart trouble\u2014\u201cso pinched and peaked always\u201d; and Uncle Wellington would take it as a personal insult, when \u201cno Stirling ever had heart disease before\u201d; and Georgiana would forebode in perfectly audible asides that \u201cpoor, dear little Doss isn\u2019t long for this world, I\u2019m afraid\u201d; and Cousin Gladys would say, \u201cWhy, my heart has been like that for years,\u201d in a tone that implied no one else had any business even to have a heart; and Olive\u2014Olive would merely look beautiful and superior and disgustingly healthy, as if to say, \u201cWhy all this fuss over a faded superfluity like Doss when you have me?\u201d\n\nValancy felt that she couldn\u2019t tell anybody unless she had to. She felt quite sure there was nothing at all seriously wrong with her heart and no need of all the pother that would ensue if she mentioned it. She would just slip up quietly and see Dr. Trent that very day. As for his bill, she had the two hundred dollars that her father had put in the bank for her the day she was born. She was never allowed to use even the interest of this, but she would secretly take out enough to pay Dr. Trent.\n\nDr. Trent was a gruff, outspoken, absent-minded old fellow, but he was a recognised authority on heart disease, even if he were only a general practitioner in out-of-the-world Deerwood. Dr. Trent was over seventy and there had been rumours that he meant to retire soon. None of the Stirling clan had ever gone to him since he had told Cousin Gladys, ten years before, that her neuritis was all imaginary and that she enjoyed it. You couldn\u2019t patronise a doctor who insulted your first-cousin-once-removed like that\u2014not to mention that he was a Presbyterian when all the Stirlings went to the Anglican church. But Valancy, between the devil of disloyalty to clan and the deep sea of fuss and clatter and advice, thought she would take a chance with the devil.\nCHAPTER II\n\nWhen Cousin Stickles knocked at her door, Valancy knew it was half-past seven and she must get up. As long as she could remember, Cousin Stickles had knocked at her door at half-past seven. Cousin Stickles and Mrs. Frederick Stirling had been up since seven, but Valancy was allowed to lie abed half an hour longer because of a family tradition that she was delicate. Valancy got up, though she hated getting up more this morning than ever she had before. What was there to get up for? Another dreary day like all the days that had preceded it, full of meaningless little tasks, joyless and unimportant, that benefited nobody. But if she did not get up at once she would not be ready for breakfast at eight o\u2019clock. Hard and fast times for meals were the rule in Mrs. Stirling\u2019s household. Breakfast at eight, dinner at one, supper at six, year in and year out. No excuses for being late were ever tolerated. So up Valancy got, shivering.\n\nThe room was bitterly cold with the raw, penetrating chill of a wet May morning. The house would be cold all day. It was one of Mrs. Frederick\u2019s rules that no fires were necessary after the twenty-fourth of May. Meals were cooked on the little oil-stove in the back porch. And though May might be icy and October frost-bitten, no fires were lighted until the twenty-first of October by the calendar. On the twenty-first of October Mrs. Frederick began cooking over the kitchen range and lighted a fire in the sitting-room stove in the evenings. It was whispered about in the connection that the late Frederick Stirling had caught the cold which resulted in his death during Valancy\u2019s first year of life because Mrs. Frederick would not have a fire on the twentieth of October. She lighted it the next day\u2014but that was a day too late for Frederick Stirling.\n\nValancy took off and hung up in the closet her nightdress of coarse, unbleached cotton, with high neck and long, tight sleeves. She put on undergarments of a similar nature, a dress of brown gingham, thick, black stockings and rubber-heeled boots. Of late years she had fallen into the habit of doing her hair with the shade of the window by the looking-glass pulled down. The lines on her face did not show so plainly then. But this morning she jerked the shade to the very top and looked at herself in the leprous mirror with a passionate determination to see herself as the world saw her.\n\nThe result was rather dreadful. Even a beauty would have found that harsh, unsoftened side-light trying. Valancy saw straight black hair, short and thin, always lustreless despite the fact that she gave it one hundred strokes of the brush, neither more nor less, every night of her life and faithfully rubbed Redfern\u2019s Hair Vigor into the roots, more lustreless than ever in its morning roughness; fine, straight, black brows; a nose she had always felt was much too small even for her small, three-cornered, white face; a small, pale mouth that always fell open a trifle over little, pointed white teeth; a figure thin and flat-breasted, rather below the average height. She had somehow escaped the family high cheek-bones, and her dark-brown eyes, too soft and shadowy to be black, had a slant that was almost Oriental. Apart from her eyes she was neither pretty nor ugly\u2014just insignificant-looking, she concluded bitterly. How plain the lines around her eyes and mouth were in that merciless light! And never had her narrow, white face looked so narrow and so white.\n\nShe did her hair in a pompadour. Pompadours had long gone out of fashion, but they had been in when Valancy first put her hair up and Aunt Wellington had decided that she must always wear her hair so.\n\n\u201cIt is the only way that becomes you. Your face is so small that you must add height to it by a pompadour effect,\u201d said Aunt Wellington, who always enunciated commonplaces as if uttering profound and important truths.\n\nValancy had hankered to do her hair pulled low on her forehead, with puffs above the ears, as Olive was wearing hers. But Aunt Wellington\u2019s dictum had such an effect on her that she never dared change her style of hairdressing again. But then, there were so many things Valancy never dared do.\n\nAll her life she had been afraid of something, she thought bitterly. From the very dawn of recollection, when she had been so horribly afraid of the big black bear that lived, so Cousin Stickles told her, in the closet under the stairs.\n\n\u201cAnd I always will be\u2014I know it\u2014I can\u2019t help it. I don\u2019t know what it would be like not to be afraid of something.\u201d\n\nAfraid of her mother\u2019s sulky fits\u2014afraid of offending Uncle Benjamin\u2014afraid of becoming a target for Aunt Wellington\u2019s contempt\u2014afraid of Aunt Isabel\u2019s biting comments\u2014afraid of Uncle James\u2019 disapproval\u2014afraid of offending the whole clan\u2019s opinions and prejudices\u2014afraid of not keeping up appearances\u2014afraid to say what she really thought of anything\u2014afraid of poverty in her old age. Fear\u2014fear\u2014fear\u2014she could never escape from it. It bound her and enmeshed her like a spider\u2019s web of steel. Only in her Blue Castle could she find temporary release. And this morning Valancy could not believe she had a Blue Castle. She would never be able to find it again. Twenty-nine, unmarried, undesired\u2014what had she to do with the fairy-like chatelaine of the Blue Castle? She would cut such childish nonsense out of her life forever and face reality unflinchingly.\n\nShe turned from her unfriendly mirror and looked out. The ugliness of the view always struck her like a blow; the ragged fence, the tumble-down old carriage-shop in the next lot, plastered with crude, violently coloured advertisements; the grimy railway station beyond, with the awful derelicts that were always hanging around it even at this early hour. In the pouring rain everything looked worse than usual, especially the beastly advertisement, \u201cKeep that schoolgirl complexion.\u201d Valancy had kept her schoolgirl complexion. That was just the trouble. There was not a gleam of beauty anywhere\u2014\u201cexactly like my life,\u201d thought Valancy drearily. Her brief bitterness had passed. She accepted facts as resignedly as she had always accepted them. She was one of the people whom life always passes by. There was no altering that fact.\n\nIn this mood Valancy went down to breakfast.\nCHAPTER III\n\nBreakfast was always the same. Oatmeal porridge, which Valancy loathed, toast and tea, and one teaspoonful of marmalade. Mrs. Frederick thought two teaspoonfuls extravagant\u2014but that did not matter to Valancy, who hated marmalade, too. The chilly, gloomy little dining-room was chillier and gloomier than usual; the rain streamed down outside the window; departed Stirlings, in atrocious, gilt frames, wider than the pictures, glowered down from the walls. And yet Cousin Stickles wished Valancy many happy returns of the day!\n\n\u201cSit up straight, Doss,\u201d was all her mother said.\n\nValancy sat up straight. She talked to her mother and Cousin Stickles of the things they always talked of. She never wondered what would happen if she tried to talk of something else. She knew. Therefore she never did it.\n\nMrs. Frederick was offended with Providence for sending a rainy day when she wanted to go to a picnic, so she ate her breakfast in a sulky silence for which Valancy was rather grateful. But Christine Stickles whined endlessly on as usual, complaining about everything\u2014the weather, the leak in the pantry, the price of oatmeal and butter\u2014Valancy felt at once she had buttered her toast too lavishly\u2014the epidemic of mumps in Deerwood.\n\n\u201cDoss will be sure to ketch them,\u201d she foreboded.\n\n\u201cDoss must not go where she is likely to catch mumps,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick shortly.\n\nValancy had never had mumps\u2014or whooping cough\u2014or chicken-pox\u2014or measles\u2014or anything she should have had\u2014nothing but horrible colds every winter. Doss\u2019 winter colds were a sort of tradition in the family. Nothing, it seemed, could prevent her from catching them. Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles did their heroic best. One winter they kept Valancy housed up from November to May, in the warm sitting-room. She was not even allowed to go to church. And Valancy took cold after cold and ended up with bronchitis in June.\n\n\u201cNone of my family were ever like that,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick, implying that it must be a Stirling tendency.\n\n\u201cThe Stirlings seldom take colds,\u201d said Cousin Stickles resentfully. She had been a Stirling.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick, \u201cthat if a person makes up her mind not to have colds she will not have colds.\u201d\n\nSo that was the trouble. It was all Valancy\u2019s own fault.\n\nBut on this particular morning Valancy\u2019s unbearable grievance was that she was called Doss. She had endured it for twenty-nine years, and all at once she felt she could not endure it any longer. Her full name was Valancy Jane. Valancy Jane was rather terrible, but she liked Valancy, with its odd, out-land tang. It was always a wonder to Valancy that the Stirlings had allowed her to be so christened. She had been told that her maternal grandfather, old Amos Wansbarra, had chosen the name for her. Her father had tacked on the Jane by way of civilising it, and the whole connection got out of the difficulty by nicknaming her Doss. She never got Valancy from any one but outsiders.\n\n\u201cMother,\u201d she said timidly, \u201cwould you mind calling me Valancy after this? Doss seems so\u2014so\u2014I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nMrs. Frederick looked at her daughter in astonishment. She wore glasses with enormously strong lenses that gave her eyes a peculiarly disagreeable appearance.\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter with Doss?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2014seems so childish,\u201d faltered Valancy.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Mrs. Frederick had been a Wansbarra and the Wansbarra smile was not an asset. \u201cI see. Well, it should suit you then. You are childish enough in all conscience, my dear child.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am twenty-nine,\u201d said the dear child desperately.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t proclaim it from the house-tops if I were you, dear,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick. \u201cTwenty-nine! I had been married nine years when I was twenty-nine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was married at seventeen,\u201d said Cousin Stickles proudly.\n\nValancy looked at them furtively. Mrs. Frederick, except for those terrible glasses and the hooked nose that made her look more like a parrot than a parrot itself could look, was not ill-looking. At twenty she might have been quite pretty. But Cousin Stickles! And yet Christine Stickles had once been desirable in some man\u2019s eyes. Valancy felt that Cousin Stickles, with her broad, flat, wrinkled face, a mole right on the end of her dumpy nose, bristling hairs on her chin, wrinkled yellow neck, pale, protruding eyes, and thin, puckered mouth, had yet this advantage over her\u2014this right to look down on her. And even yet Cousin Stickles was necessary to Mrs. Frederick. Valancy wondered pitifully what it would be like to be wanted by some one\u2014needed by some one. No one in the whole world needed her, or would miss anything from life if she dropped suddenly out of it. She was a disappointment to her mother. No one loved her. She had never so much as had a girl friend.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even a gift for friendship,\u201d she had once admitted to herself pitifully.\n\n\u201cDoss, you haven\u2019t eaten your crusts,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick rebukingly.\n\nIt rained all the forenoon without cessation. Valancy pieced a quilt. Valancy hated piecing quilts. And there was no need of it. The house was full of quilts. There were three big chests, packed with quilts, in the attic. Mrs. Frederick had begun storing away quilts when Valancy was seventeen and she kept on storing them, though it did not seem likely that Valancy would ever need them. But Valancy must be at work and fancy work materials were too expensive. Idleness was a cardinal sin in the Stirling household. When Valancy had been a child she had been made to write down every night, in a small, hated, black notebook, all the minutes she had spent in idleness that day. On Sundays her mother made her tot them up and pray over them.\n\nOn this particular forenoon of this day of destiny Valancy spent only ten minutes in idleness. At least, Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles would have called it idleness. She went to her room to get a better thimble and she opened Thistle Harvest guiltily at random.\n\n\u201cThe woods are so human,\u201d wrote John Foster, \u201cthat to know them one must live with them. An occasional saunter through them, keeping to the well-trodden paths, will never admit us to their intimacy. If we wish to be friends we must seek them out and win them by frequent, reverent visits at all hours; by morning, by noon, and by night; and at all seasons, in spring, in summer, in autumn, in winter. Otherwise we can never really know them and any pretence we may make to the contrary will never impose on them. They have their own effective way of keeping aliens at a distance and shutting their hearts to mere casual sightseers. It is of no use to seek the woods from any motive except sheer love of them; they will find us out at once and hide all their sweet, old-world secrets from us. But if they know we come to them because we love them they will be very kind to us and give us such treasures of beauty and delight as are not bought or sold in any market-place. For the woods, when they give at all, give unstintedly and hold nothing back from their true worshippers. We must go to them lovingly, humbly, patiently, watchfully, and we shall learn what poignant loveliness lurks in the wild places and silent intervals, lying under starshine and sunset, what cadences of unearthly music are harped on aged pine boughs or crooned in copses of fir, what delicate savours exhale from mosses and ferns in sunny corners or on damp brooklands, what dreams and myths and legends of an older time haunt them. Then the immortal heart of the woods will beat against ours and its subtle life will steal into our veins and make us its own forever, so that no matter where we go or how widely we wander we shall yet be drawn back to the forest to find our most enduring kinship.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoss,\u201d called her mother from the hall below, \u201cwhat are you doing all by yourself in that room?\u201d\n\nValancy dropped Thistle Harvest like a hot coal and fled downstairs to her patches; but she felt the strange exhilaration of spirit that always came momentarily to her when she dipped into one of John Foster\u2019s books. Valancy did not know much about woods\u2014except the haunted groves of oak and pine around her Blue Castle. But she had always secretly hankered after them and a Foster book about woods was the next best thing to the woods themselves.\n\nAt noon it stopped raining, but the sun did not come out until three. Then Valancy timidly said she thought she would go uptown.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want to go uptown for?\u201d demanded her mother.\n\n\u201cI want to get a book from the library.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got a book from the library only last week.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it was four weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cFour weeks. Nonsense!\u201d\n\n\u201cReally it was, Mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are mistaken. It cannot possibly have been more than two weeks. I dislike contradiction. And I do not see what you want to get a book for, anyhow. You waste too much time reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf what value is my time?\u201d asked Valancy bitterly.\n\n\u201cDoss! Don\u2019t speak in that tone to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need some tea,\u201d said Cousin Stickles. \u201cShe might go and get that if she wants a walk\u2014though this damp weather is bad for colds.\u201d\n\nThey argued the matter for ten minutes longer and finally Mrs. Frederick agreed rather grudgingly that Valancy might go.\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\u201cGot your rubbers on?\u201d called Cousin Stickles, as Valancy left the house.\n\nChristine Stickles had never once forgotten to ask that question when Valancy went out on a damp day.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you got your flannel petticoat on?\u201d asked Mrs. Frederick.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoss, I really do not understand you. Do you want to catch your death of cold again?\u201d Her voice implied that Valancy had died of a cold several times already. \u201cGo upstairs this minute and put it on!\u201d\n\n\u201cMother, I don\u2019t need a flannel petticoat. My sateen one is warm enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoss, remember you had bronchitis two years ago. Go and do as you are told!\u201d\n\nValancy went, though nobody will ever know just how near she came to hurling the rubber-plant into the street before she went. She hated that grey flannel petticoat more than any other garment she owned. Olive never had to wear flannel petticoats. Olive wore ruffled silk and sheer lawn and filmy laced flounces. But Olive\u2019s father had \u201cmarried money\u201d and Olive never had bronchitis. So there you were.\n\n\u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t leave the soap in the water?\u201d demanded Mrs. Frederick. But Valancy was gone. She turned at the corner and looked back down the ugly, prim, respectable street where she lived. The Stirling house was the ugliest on it\u2014more like a red brick box than anything else. Too high for its breadth, and made still higher by a bulbous glass cupola on top. About it was the desolate, barren peace of an old house whose life is lived.\n\nThere was a very pretty little house, with leaded casements and dubbed gables, just around the corner\u2014a new house, one of those houses you love the minute you see them. Clayton Markley had built it for his bride. He was to be married to Jennie Lloyd in June. The little house, it was said, was furnished from attic to cellar, in complete readiness for its mistress.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t envy Jennie the man,\u201d thought Valancy sincerely\u2014Clayton Markley was not one of her many ideals\u2014\u201cbut I do envy her the house. It\u2019s such a nice young house. Oh, if I could only have a house of my own\u2014ever so poor, so tiny\u2014but my own! But then,\u201d she added bitterly, \u201cthere is no use in yowling for the moon when you can\u2019t even get a tallow candle.\u201d\n\nIn dreamland nothing would do Valancy but a castle of pale sapphire. In real life she would have been fully satisfied with a little house of her own. She envied Jennie Lloyd more fiercely than ever today. Jennie was not so much better looking than she was, and not so very much younger. Yet she was to have this delightful house. And the nicest little Wedgwood teacups\u2014Valancy had seen them; an open fireplace, and monogrammed linen; hemstitched tablecloths, and china-closets. Why did everything come to some girls and nothing to others? It wasn\u2019t fair.\n\nValancy was once more seething with rebellion as she walked along, a prim, dowdy little figure in her shabby raincoat and three-year-old hat, splashed occasionally by the mud of a passing motor with its insulting shrieks. Motors were still rather a novelty in Deerwood, though they were common in Port Lawrence, and most of the summer residents up at Muskoka had them. In Deerwood only some of the smart set had them; for even Deerwood was divided into sets. There was the smart set\u2014the intellectual set\u2014the old-family set\u2014of which the Stirlings were members\u2014the common run, and a few pariahs. Not one of the Stirling clan had as yet condescended to a motor, though Olive was teasing her father to have one. Valancy had never even been in a motorcar. But she did not hanker after this. In truth, she felt rather afraid of motorcars, especially at night. They seemed to be too much like big purring beasts that might turn and crush you\u2014or make some terrible savage leap somewhere. On the steep mountain trails around her Blue Castle only gaily caparisoned steeds might proudly pace; in real life Valancy would have been quite contented to drive in a buggy behind a nice horse. She got a buggy drive only when some uncle or cousin remembered to fling her \u201ca chance,\u201d like a bone to a dog.\nCHAPTER V\n\nOf course she must buy the tea in Uncle Benjamin\u2019s grocery-store. To buy it anywhere else was unthinkable. Yet Valancy hated to go to Uncle Benjamin\u2019s store on her twenty-ninth birthday. There was no hope that he would not remember it.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d demanded Uncle Benjamin, leeringly, as he tied up her tea, \u201care young ladies like bad grammarians?\u201d\n\nValancy, with Uncle Benjamin\u2019s will in the background of her mind, said meekly, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d chuckled Uncle Benjamin, \u201cthey can\u2019t decline matrimony.\u201d\n\nThe two clerks, Joe Hammond and Claude Bertram, chuckled also, and Valancy disliked them a little more than ever. On the first day Claude Bertram had seen her in the store she had heard him whisper to Joe, \u201cWho is that?\u201d And Joe had said, \u201cValancy Stirling\u2014one of the Deerwood old maids.\u201d \u201cCurable or incurable?\u201d Claude had asked with a snicker, evidently thinking the question very clever. Valancy smarted anew with the sting of that old recollection.\n\n\u201cTwenty-nine,\u201d Uncle Benjamin was saying. \u201cDear me, Doss, you\u2019re dangerously near the second corner and not even thinking of getting married yet. Twenty-nine. It seems impossible.\u201d\n\nThen Uncle Benjamin said an original thing. Uncle Benjamin said, \u201cHow time does fly!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it crawls,\u201d said Valancy passionately. Passion was so alien to Uncle Benjamin\u2019s conception of Valancy that he didn\u2019t know what to make of her. To cover his confusion, he asked another conundrum as he tied up her beans\u2014Cousin Stickles had remembered at the last moment that they must have beans. Beans were cheap and filling.\n\n\u201cWhat two ages are apt to prove illusory?\u201d asked Uncle Benjamin; and, not waiting for Valancy to \u201cgive it up,\u201d he added, \u201cMir-age and marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cM-i-r-a-g-e is pronounced mirazh,\u201d said Valancy shortly, picking up her tea and her beans. For the moment she did not care whether Uncle Benjamin cut her out of his will or not. She walked out of the store while Uncle Benjamin stared after her with his mouth open. Then he shook his head.\n\n\u201cPoor Doss is taking it hard,\u201d he said.\n\nValancy was sorry by the time she reached the next crossing. Why had she lost her patience like that? Uncle Benjamin would be annoyed and would likely tell her mother that Doss had been impertinent\u2014\u201cto me!\u201d\u2014and her mother would lecture her for a week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve held my tongue for twenty years,\u201d thought Valancy. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I have held it once more?\u201d\n\nYes, it was just twenty, Valancy reflected, since she had first been twitted with her loverless condition. She remembered the bitter moment perfectly. She was just nine years old and she was standing alone on the school playground while the other little girls of her class were playing a game in which you must be chosen by a boy as his partner before you could play. Nobody had chosen Valancy\u2014little, pale, black-haired Valancy, with her prim, long-sleeved apron and odd, slanted eyes.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said a pretty little girl to her, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for you. You haven\u2019t got a beau.\u201d\n\nValancy had said defiantly, as she continued to say for twenty years, \u201cI don\u2019t want a beau.\u201d But this afternoon Valancy once and for all stopped saying that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with myself anyhow,\u201d she thought savagely. \u201cUncle Benjamin\u2019s riddles hurt me because they are true. I do want to be married. I want a house of my own\u2014I want a husband of my own\u2014I want sweet, little fat babies of my own\u2014\u201d Valancy stopped suddenly aghast at her own recklessness. She felt sure that Rev. Dr. Stalling, who passed her at this moment, read her thoughts and disapproved of them thoroughly. Valancy was afraid of Dr. Stalling\u2014had been afraid of him ever since the Sunday, twenty-three years before, when he had first come to St. Albans\u2019. Valancy had been too late for Sunday School that day and she had gone into the church timidly and sat in their pew. No one else was in the church\u2014nobody except the new rector, Dr. Stalling. Dr. Stalling stood up in front of the choir door, beckoned to her, and said sternly, \u201cLittle boy, come up here.\u201d\n\nValancy had stared around her. There was no little boy\u2014there was no one in all the huge church but herself. This strange man with the blue glasses couldn\u2019t mean her. She was not a boy.\n\n\u201cLittle boy,\u201d repeated Dr. Stalling, more sternly still, shaking his forefinger fiercely at her, \u201ccome up here at once!\u201d\n\nValancy arose as if hypnotised and walked up the aisle. She was too terrified to do anything else. What dreadful thing was going to happen to her? What had happened to her? Had she actually turned into a boy? She came to a stop in front of Dr. Stalling. Dr. Stalling shook his forefinger\u2014such a long, knuckly forefinger\u2014at her and said:\n\n\u201cLittle boy, take off your hat.\u201d\n\nValancy took off her hat. She had a scrawny little pigtail hanging down her back, but Dr. Stalling was short-sighted and did not perceive it.\n\n\u201cLittle boy, go back to your seat and always take off your hat in church. Remember!\u201d\n\nValancy went back to her seat carrying her hat like an automaton. Presently her mother came in.\n\n\u201cDoss,\u201d said Mrs. Stirling, \u201cwhat do you mean by taking off your hat? Put it on instantly!\u201d\n\nValancy put it on instantly. She was cold with fear lest Dr. Stalling should immediately summon her up front again. She would have to go, of course\u2014it never occurred to her that one could disobey the rector\u2014and the church was full of people now. Oh, what would she do if that horrible, stabbing forefinger were shaken at her again before all those people? Valancy sat through the whole service in an agony of dread and was sick for a week afterwards. Nobody knew why\u2014Mrs. Frederick again bemoaned herself of her delicate child.\n\nDr. Stalling found out his mistake and laughed over it to Valancy\u2014who did not laugh. She never got over her dread of Dr. Stalling. And now to be caught by him on the street corner, thinking such things!\n\nValancy got her John Foster book\u2014Magic of Wings. \u201cHis latest\u2014all about birds,\u201d said Miss Clarkson. She had almost decided that she would go home, instead of going to see Dr. Trent. Her courage had failed her. She was afraid of offending Uncle James\u2014afraid of angering her mother\u2014afraid of facing gruff, shaggy-browed old Dr. Trent, who would probably tell her, as he had told Cousin Gladys, that her trouble was entirely imaginary and that she only had it because she liked to have it. No, she would not go; she would get a bottle of Redfern\u2019s Purple Pills instead. Redfern\u2019s Purple Pills were the standard medicine of the Stirling clan. Had they not cured Second Cousin Geraldine when five doctors had given her up? Valancy always felt very sceptical concerning the virtues of the Purple Pills; but there might be something in them; and it was easier to take them than to face Dr. Trent alone. She would glance over the magazines in the reading-room a few minutes and then go home.\n\nValancy tried to read a story, but it made her furious. On every page was a picture of the heroine surrounded by adoring men. And here was she, Valancy Stirling, who could not get a solitary beau! Valancy slammed the magazine shut; she opened Magic of Wings. Her eyes fell on the paragraph that changed her life.\n\n\u201cFear is the original sin,\u201d wrote John Foster. \u201cAlmost all the evil in the world has its origin in the fact that some one is afraid of something. It is a cold, slimy serpent coiling about you. It is horrible to live with fear; and it is of all things degrading.\u201d\n\nValancy shut Magic of Wings and stood up. She would go and see Dr. Trent.\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe ordeal was not so dreadful, after all. Dr. Trent was as gruff and abrupt as usual, but he did not tell her ailment was imaginary. After he had listened to her symptoms and asked a few questions and made a quick examination, he sat for a moment looking at her quite intently. Valancy thought he looked as if he were sorry for her. She caught her breath for a moment. Was the trouble serious? Oh, it couldn\u2019t be, surely\u2014it really hadn\u2019t bothered her much\u2014only lately it had got a little worse.\n\nDr. Trent opened his mouth\u2014but before he could speak the telephone at his elbow rang sharply. He picked up the receiver. Valancy, watching him, saw his face change suddenly as he listened, \u201c\u2018Lo\u2014yes\u2014yes\u2014what?\u2014yes\u2014yes\u201d\u2014a brief interval\u2014\u201cMy God!\u201d\n\nDr. Trent dropped the receiver, dashed out of the room and upstairs without even a glance at Valancy. She heard him rushing madly about overhead, barking out a few remarks to somebody\u2014presumably his housekeeper. Then he came tearing downstairs with a club bag in his hand, snatched his hat and coat from the rack, jerked open the street door and rushed down the street in the direction of the station.\n\nValancy sat alone in the little office, feeling more absolutely foolish than she had ever felt before in her life. Foolish\u2014and humiliated. So this was all that had come of her heroic determination to live up to John Foster and cast fear aside. Not only was she a failure as a relative and non-existent as a sweetheart or friend, but she was not even of any importance as a patient. Dr. Trent had forgotten her very presence in his excitement over whatever message had come by the telephone. She had gained nothing by ignoring Uncle James and flying in the face of family tradition.\n\nFor a moment she was afraid she was going to cry. It was all so\u2014ridiculous. Then she heard Dr. Trent\u2019s housekeeper coming down the stairs. Valancy rose and went to the office door.\n\n\u201cThe doctor forgot all about me,\u201d she said with a twisted smile.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s too bad,\u201d said Mrs. Patterson sympathetically. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t much wonder, poor man. That was a telegram they \u2019phoned over from the Port. His son has been terribly injured in an auto accident in Montreal. The doctor had just ten minutes to catch the train. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do if anything happens to Ned\u2014he\u2019s just bound up in the boy. You\u2019ll have to come again, Miss Stirling. I hope it\u2019s nothing serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, nothing serious,\u201d agreed Valancy. She felt a little less humiliated. It was no wonder poor Dr. Trent had forgotten her at such a moment. Nevertheless, she felt very flat and discouraged as she went down the street.\n\nValancy went home by the short-cut of Lover\u2019s Lane. She did not often go through Lover\u2019s Lane\u2014but it was getting near supper-time and it would never do to be late. Lover\u2019s Lane wound back of the village, under great elms and maples, and deserved its name. It was hard to go there at any time and not find some canoodling couple\u2014or young girls in pairs, arms intertwined, earnestly talking over their little secrets. Valancy didn\u2019t know which made her feel more self-conscious and uncomfortable.\n\nThis evening she encountered both. She met Connie Hale and Kate Bayley, in new pink organdy dresses with flowers stuck coquettishly in their glossy, bare hair. Valancy had never had a pink dress or worn flowers in her hair. Then she passed a young couple she didn\u2019t know, dandering along, oblivious to everything but themselves. The young man\u2019s arm was around the girl\u2019s waist quite shamelessly. Valancy had never walked with a man\u2019s arm about her. She felt that she ought to be shocked\u2014they might leave that sort of thing for the screening twilight, at least\u2014but she wasn\u2019t shocked. In another flash of desperate, stark honesty she owned to herself that she was merely envious. When she passed them she felt quite sure they were laughing at her\u2014pitying her\u2014\u201cthere\u2019s that queer little old maid, Valancy Stirling. They say she never had a beau in her whole life\u201d\u2014Valancy fairly ran to get out of Lover\u2019s Lane. Never had she felt so utterly colourless and skinny and insignificant.\n\nJust where Lover\u2019s Lane debouched on the street, an old car was parked. Valancy knew that car well\u2014by sound, at least\u2014and everybody in Deerwood knew it. This was before the phrase \u201ctin Lizzie\u201d had come into circulation\u2014in Deerwood, at least; but if it had been known, this car was the tinniest of Lizzies\u2014though it was not a Ford but an old Grey Slosson. Nothing more battered and disreputable could be imagined.\n\nIt was Barney Snaith\u2019s car and Barney himself was just scrambling up from under it, in overalls plastered with mud. Valancy gave him a swift, furtive look as she hurried by. This was only the second time she had ever seen the notorious Barney Snaith, though she had heard enough about him in the five years that he had been living \u201cup back\u201d in Muskoka. The first time had been nearly a year ago, on the Muskoka road. He had been crawling out from under his car then, too, and he had given her a cheerful grin as she went by\u2014a little, whimsical grin that gave him the look of an amused gnome. He didn\u2019t look bad\u2014she didn\u2019t believe he was bad, in spite of the wild yarns that were always being told of him. Of course he went tearing in that terrible old Grey Slosson through Deerwood at hours when all decent people were in bed\u2014often with old \u201cRoaring Abel,\u201d who made the night hideous with his howls\u2014\u201cboth of them dead drunk, my dear.\u201d And every one knew that he was an escaped convict and a defaulting bank clerk and a murderer in hiding and an infidel and an illegitimate son of old Roaring Abel Gay and the father of Roaring Abel\u2019s illegitimate grandchild and a counterfeiter and a forger and a few other awful things. But still Valancy didn\u2019t believe he was bad. Nobody with a smile like that could be bad, no matter what he had done.\n\nIt was that night the Prince of the Blue Castle changed from a being of grim jaw and hair with a dash of premature grey to a rakish individual with overlong, tawny hair, dashed with red, dark-brown eyes, and ears that stuck out just enough to give him an alert look but not enough to be called flying jibs. But he still retained something a little grim about the jaw.\n\nBarney Snaith looked even more disreputable than usual just now. It was very evident that he hadn\u2019t shaved for days, and his hands and arms, bare to the shoulders, were black with grease. But he was whistling gleefully to himself and he seemed so happy that Valancy envied him. She envied him his light-heartedness and his irresponsibility and his mysterious little cabin up on an island in Lake Mistawis\u2014even his rackety old Grey Slosson. Neither he nor his car had to be respectable and live up to traditions. When he rattled past her a few minutes later, bareheaded, leaning back in his Lizzie at a raffish angle, his longish hair blowing in the wind, a villainous-looking old black pipe in his mouth, she envied him again. Men had the best of it, no doubt about that. This outlaw was happy, whatever he was or wasn\u2019t. She, Valancy Stirling, respectable, well-behaved to the last degree, was unhappy and had always been unhappy. So there you were.\n\nValancy was just in time for supper. The sun had clouded over, and a dismal, drizzling rain was falling again. Cousin Stickles had the neuralgia. Valancy had to do the family darning and there was no time for Magic of Wings.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t the darning wait till tomorrow?\u201d she pleaded.\n\n\u201cTomorrow will bring its own duties,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick inexorably.\n\nValancy darned all the evening and listened to Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles talking the eternal, niggling gossip of the clan, as they knitted drearily at interminable black stockings. They discussed Second Cousin Lilian\u2019s approaching wedding in all its bearings. On the whole, they approved. Second Cousin Lilian was doing well for herself.\n\n\u201cThough she hasn\u2019t hurried,\u201d said Cousin Stickles. \u201cShe must be twenty-five.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have not\u2014fortunately\u2014been many old maids in our connection,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick bitterly.\n\nValancy flinched. She had run the darning needle into her finger.\n\nThird Cousin Aaron Gray had been scratched by a cat and had blood-poisoning in his finger. \u201cCats are most dangerous animals,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick. \u201cI would never have a cat about the house.\u201d\n\nShe glared significantly at Valancy through her terrible glasses. Once, five years ago, Valancy had asked if she might have a cat. She had never referred to it since, but Mrs. Frederick still suspected her of harbouring the unlawful desire in her heart of hearts.\n\nOnce Valancy sneezed. Now, in the Stirling code, it was very bad form to sneeze in public.\n\n\u201cYou can always repress a sneeze by pressing your finger on your upper lip,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick rebukingly.\n\nHalf-past nine o\u2019clock and so, as Mr. Pepys would say, to bed. But First Cousin Stickles\u2019 neuralgic back must be rubbed with Redfern\u2019s Liniment. Valancy did that. Valancy always had to do it. She hated the smell of Redfern\u2019s Liniment\u2014she hated the smug, beaming, portly, be-whiskered, be-spectacled picture of Dr. Redfern on the bottle. Her fingers smelled of the horrible stuff after she got into bed, in spite of all the scrubbing she gave them.\n\nValancy\u2019s day of destiny had come and gone. She ended it as she had begun it, in tears.\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThere was a rosebush on the little Stirling lawn, growing beside the gate. It was called \u201cDoss\u2019s rosebush.\u201d Cousin Georgiana had given it to Valancy five years ago and Valancy had planted it joyfully. She loved roses. But\u2014of course\u2014the rosebush never bloomed. That was her luck. Valancy did everything she could think of and took the advice of everybody in the clan, but still the rosebush would not bloom. It throve and grew luxuriantly, with great leafy branches untouched of rust or spider; but not even a bud had ever appeared on it. Valancy, looking at it two days after her birthday, was filled with a sudden, overwhelming hatred for it. The thing wouldn\u2019t bloom: very well, then, she would cut it down. She marched to the tool-room in the barn for her garden knife and she went at the rosebush viciously. A few minutes later horrified Mrs. Frederick came out to the verandah and beheld her daughter slashing insanely among the rosebush boughs. Half of them were already strewn on the walk. The bush looked sadly dismantled.\n\n\u201cDoss, what on earth are you doing? Have you gone crazy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Valancy. She meant to say it defiantly, but habit was too strong for her. She said it deprecatingly. \u201cI\u2014I just made up my mind to cut this bush down. It is no good. It never blooms\u2014never will bloom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is no reason for destroying it,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick sternly. \u201cIt was a beautiful bush and quite ornamental. You have made a sorry-looking thing of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRose trees should bloom,\u201d said Valancy a little obstinately.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me, Doss. Clear up that mess and leave the bush alone. I don\u2019t know what Georgiana will say when she sees how you have hacked it to pieces. Really, I\u2019m surprised at you. And to do it without consulting me!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bush is mine,\u201d muttered Valancy.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that? What did you say, Doss?\u201d\n\n\u201cI only said the bush was mine,\u201d repeated Valancy humbly.\n\nMrs. Frederick turned without a word and marched back into the house. The mischief was done now. Valancy knew she had offended her mother deeply and would not be spoken to or noticed in any way for two or three days. Cousin Stickles would see to Valancy\u2019s bringing-up but Mrs. Frederick would preserve the stony silence of outraged majesty.\n\nValancy sighed and put away her garden knife, hanging it precisely on its precise nail in the tool-shop. She cleared away the severed branches and swept up the leaves. Her lips twitched as she looked at the straggling bush. It had an odd resemblance to its shaken, scrawny donor, little Cousin Georgiana herself.\n\n\u201cI certainly have made an awful-looking thing of it,\u201d thought Valancy.\n\nBut she did not feel repentant\u2014only sorry she had offended her mother. Things would be so uncomfortable until she was forgiven. Mrs. Frederick was one of those women who can make their anger felt all over a house. Walls and doors are no protection from it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better go uptown and git the mail,\u201d said Cousin Stickles, when Valancy went in. \u201cI can\u2019t go\u2014I feel all sorter peaky and piny this spring. I want you to stop at the drugstore and git me a bottle of Redfern\u2019s Blood Bitters. There\u2019s nothing like Redfern\u2019s Bitters for building a body up. Cousin James says the Purple Pills are the best, but I know better. My poor dear husband took Redfern\u2019s Bitters right up to the day he died. Don\u2019t let them charge you more\u2019n ninety cents. I kin git it for that at the Port. And what have you been saying to your poor mother? Do you ever stop to think, Doss, that you kin only have one mother?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne is enough for me,\u201d thought Valancy undutifully, as she went uptown.\n\nShe got Cousin Stickles\u2019 bottle of bitters and then she went to the post-office and asked for her mail at the General Delivery. Her mother did not have a box. They got too little mail to bother with it. Valancy did not expect any mail, except the Christian Times, which was the only paper they took. They hardly ever got any letters. But Valancy rather liked to stand in the office and watch Mr. Carewe, the grey-bearded, Santa-Clausy old clerk, handing out letters to the lucky people who did get them. He did it with such a detached, impersonal, Jove-like air, as if it did not matter in the least to him what supernal joys or shattering horrors might be in those letters for the people to whom they were addressed. Letters had a fascination for Valancy, perhaps because she so seldom got any. In her Blue Castle exciting epistles, bound with silk and sealed with crimson, were always being brought to her by pages in livery of gold and blue, but in real life her only letters were occasional perfunctory notes from relatives or an advertising circular.\n\nConsequently she was immensely surprised when Mr. Carewe, looking even more Jovian than usual, poked a letter out to her. Yes, it was addressed to her plainly, in a fierce, black hand: \u201cMiss Valancy Stirling, Elm Street, Deerwood\u201d\u2014and the postmark was Montreal. Valancy picked it up with a little quickening of her breath. Montreal! It must be from Doctor Trent. He had remembered her, after all.\n\nValancy met Uncle Benjamin coming in as she was going out and was glad the letter was safely in her bag.\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d said Uncle Benjamin, \u201cis the difference between a donkey and a postage-stamp?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. What?\u201d answered Valancy dutifully.\n\n\u201cOne you lick with a stick and the other you stick with a lick. Ha, ha!\u201d\n\nUncle Benjamin passed in, tremendously pleased with himself.\n\nCousin Stickles pounced on the Times when Valancy got home, but it did not occur to her to ask if there were any letters. Mrs. Frederick would have asked it, but Mrs. Frederick\u2019s lips at present were sealed. Valancy was glad of this. If her mother had asked if there were any letters Valancy would have had to admit there was. Then she would have had to let her mother and Cousin Stickles read the letter and all would be discovered.\n\nHer heart acted strangely on the way upstairs, and she sat down by her window for a few minutes before opening her letter. She felt very guilty and deceitful. She had never before kept a letter secret from her mother. Every letter she had ever written or received had been read by Mrs. Frederick. That had never mattered. Valancy had never had anything to hide. But this did matter. She could not have any one see this letter. But her fingers trembled with a consciousness of wickedness and unfilial conduct as she opened it\u2014trembled a little, too, perhaps, with apprehension. She felt quite sure there was nothing seriously wrong with her heart but\u2014one never knew.\n\nDr. Trent\u2019s letter was like himself\u2014blunt, abrupt, concise, wasting no words. Dr. Trent never beat about the bush. \u201cDear Miss Sterling\u201d\u2014and then a page of black, positive writing. Valancy seemed to read it at a glance; she dropped it on her lap, her face ghost-white.\n\nDr. Trent told her that she had a very dangerous and fatal form of heart disease\u2014angina pectoris\u2014evidently complicated with an aneurism\u2014whatever that was\u2014and in the last stages. He said, without mincing matters, that nothing could be done for her. If she took great care of herself she might live a year\u2014but she might also die at any moment\u2014Dr. Trent never troubled himself about euphemisms. She must be careful to avoid all excitement and all severe muscular efforts. She must eat and drink moderately, she must never run, she must go upstairs and uphill with great care. Any sudden jolt or shock might be fatal. She was to get the prescription he enclosed filled and carry it with her always, taking a dose whenever her attacks came on. And he was hers truly, H. B. Trent.\n\nValancy sat for a long while by her window. Outside was a world drowned in the light of a spring afternoon\u2014skies entrancingly blue, winds perfumed and free, lovely, soft, blue hazes at the end of every street. Over at the railway station a group of young girls was waiting for a train; she heard their gay laughter as they chattered and joked. The train roared in and roared out again. But none of these things had any reality. Nothing had any reality except the fact that she had only another year to live.\n\nWhen she was tired of sitting at the window she went over and lay down on her bed, staring at the cracked, discoloured ceiling. The curious numbness that follows on a staggering blow possessed her. She did not feel anything except a boundless surprise and incredulity\u2014behind which was the conviction that Dr. Trent knew his business and that she, Valancy Stirling, who had never lived, was about to die.\n\nWhen the gong rang for supper Valancy got up and went downstairs mechanically, from force of habit. She wondered that she had been let alone so long. But of course her mother would not pay any attention to her just now. Valancy was thankful for this. She thought the quarrel over the rosebush had been really, as Mrs. Frederick herself might have said, Providential. She could not eat anything, but both Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles thought this was because she was deservedly unhappy over her mother\u2019s attitude, and her lack of appetite was not commented on. Valancy forced herself to swallow a cup of tea and then sat and watched the others eat, with an odd feeling that years had passed since she had sat with them at the dinner-table. She found herself smiling inwardly to think what a commotion she could make if she chose. Let her merely tell them what was in Dr. Trent\u2019s letter and there would be as much fuss made as if\u2014Valancy thought bitterly\u2014they really cared two straws about her.\n\n\u201cDr. Trent\u2019s housekeeper got word from him today,\u201d said Cousin Stickles, so suddenly that Valancy jumped guiltily. Was there anything in thought waves? \u201cMrs. Judd was talking to her uptown. They think his son will recover, but Dr. Trent wrote that if he did he was going to take him abroad as soon as he was able to travel and wouldn\u2019t be back here for a year at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will not matter much to us,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick majestically. \u201cHe is not our doctor. I would not\u201d\u2014here she looked or seemed to look accusingly right through Valancy\u2014\u201chave him to doctor a sick cat.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay I go upstairs and lie down?\u201d said Valancy faintly. \u201cI\u2014I have a headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat has given you a headache?\u201d asked Cousin Stickles, since Mrs. Frederick would not. The question had to be asked. Valancy could not be allowed to have headaches without interference.\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t in the habit of having headaches. I hope you\u2019re not taking the mumps. Here, try a spoonful of vinegar.\u201d\n\n\u201cPiffle!\u201d said Valancy rudely, getting up from the table. She did not care just then if she were rude. She had had to be so polite all her life.\n\nIf it had been possible for Cousin Stickles to turn pale she would have. As it was not, she turned yellower.\n\n\u201cAre you sure you ain\u2019t feverish, Doss? You sound like it. You go and get right into bed,\u201d said Cousin Stickles, thoroughly alarmed, \u201cand I\u2019ll come up and rub your forehead and the back of your neck with Redfern\u2019s Liniment.\u201d\n\nValancy had reached the door, but she turned. \u201cI won\u2019t be rubbed with Redfern\u2019s Liniment!\u201d she said.\n\nCousin Stickles stared and gasped. \u201cWhat\u2014what do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t be rubbed with Redfern\u2019s Liniment,\u201d repeated Valancy. \u201cHorrid, sticky stuff! And it has the vilest smell of any liniment I ever saw. It\u2019s no good. I want to be left alone, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nValancy went out, leaving Cousin Stickles aghast.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s feverish\u2014she must be feverish,\u201d ejaculated Cousin Stickles.\n\nMrs. Frederick went on eating her supper. It did not matter whether Valancy was or was not feverish. Valancy had been guilty of impertinence to her.\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nValancy did not sleep that night. She lay awake all through the long dark hours\u2014thinking\u2014thinking. She made a discovery that surprised her: she, who had been afraid of almost everything in life, was not afraid of death. It did not seem in the least terrible to her. And she need not now be afraid of anything else. Why had she been afraid of things? Because of life. Afraid of Uncle Benjamin because of the menace of poverty in old age. But now she would never be old\u2014neglected\u2014tolerated. Afraid of being an old maid all her life. But now she would not be an old maid very long. Afraid of offending her mother and her clan because she had to live with and among them and couldn\u2019t live peaceably if she didn\u2019t give in to them. But now she hadn\u2019t. Valancy felt a curious freedom.\n\nBut she was still horribly afraid of one thing\u2014the fuss the whole jamfry of them would make when she told them. Valancy shuddered at the thought of it. She couldn\u2019t endure it. Oh, she knew so well how it would be. First there would be indignation\u2014yes, indignation on the part of Uncle James because she had gone to a doctor\u2014any doctor\u2014without consulting HIM. Indignation on the part of her mother for being so sly and deceitful\u2014\u201cto your own mother, Doss.\u201d Indignation on the part of the whole clan because she had not gone to Dr. Marsh.\n\nThen would come the solicitude. She would be taken to Dr. Marsh, and when Dr. Marsh confirmed Dr. Trent\u2019s diagnosis she would be taken to specialists in Toronto and Montreal. Uncle Benjamin would foot the bill with a splendid gesture of munificence in thus assisting the widow and orphan, and talk forever after of the shocking fees specialists charged for looking wise and saying they couldn\u2019t do anything. And when the specialists could do nothing for her Uncle James would insist on her taking Purple Pills\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve known them to effect a cure when all the doctors had given up\u201d\u2014and her mother would insist on Redfern\u2019s Blood Bitters, and Cousin Stickles would insist on rubbing her over the heart every night with Redfern\u2019s Liniment on the grounds that it might do good and couldn\u2019t do harm; and everybody else would have some pet dope for her to take. Dr. Stalling would come to her and say solemnly, \u201cYou are very ill. Are you prepared for what may be before you?\u201d\u2014almost as if he were going to shake his forefinger at her, the forefinger that had not grown any shorter or less knobbly with age. And she would be watched and checked like a baby and never let do anything or go anywhere alone. Perhaps she would not even be allowed to sleep alone lest she die in her sleep. Cousin Stickles or her mother would insist on sharing her room and bed. Yes, undoubtedly they would.\n\nIt was this last thought that really decided Valancy. She could not put up with it and she wouldn\u2019t. As the clock in the hall below struck twelve Valancy suddenly and definitely made up her mind that she would not tell anybody. She had always been told, ever since she could remember, that she must hide her feelings. \u201cIt is not ladylike to have feelings,\u201d Cousin Stickles had once told her disapprovingly. Well, she would hide them with a vengeance.\n\nBut though she was not afraid of death she was not indifferent to it. She found that she resented it; it was not fair that she should have to die when she had never lived. Rebellion flamed up in her soul as the dark hours passed by\u2014not because she had no future but because she had no past.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m poor\u2014I\u2019m ugly\u2014I\u2019m a failure\u2014and I\u2019m near death,\u201d she thought. She could see her own obituary notice in the Deerwood Weekly Times, copied into the Port Lawrence Journal. \u201cA deep gloom was cast over Deerwood, etc., etc.\u201d\u2014\u201cleaves a large circle of friends to mourn, etc., etc., etc.\u201d\u2014lies, all lies. Gloom, forsooth! Nobody would miss her. Her death would not matter a straw to anybody. Not even her mother loved her\u2014her mother who had been so disappointed that she was not a boy\u2014or at least, a pretty girl.\n\nValancy reviewed her whole life between midnight and the early spring dawn. It was a very drab existence, but here and there an incident loomed out with a significance out of all proportion to its real importance. These incidents were all unpleasant in one way or another. Nothing really pleasant had ever happened to Valancy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had one wholly happy hour in my life\u2014not one,\u201d she thought. \u201cI\u2019ve just been a colourless nonentity. I remember reading somewhere once that there is an hour in which a woman might be happy all her life if she could but find it. I\u2019ve never found my hour\u2014never, never. And I never will now. If I could only have had that hour I\u2019d be willing to die.\u201d\n\nThose significant incidents kept bobbing up in her mind like unbidden ghosts, without any sequence of time or place. For instance, that time when, at sixteen, she had blued a tubful of clothes too deeply. And the time when, at eight, she had \u201cstolen\u201d some raspberry jam from Aunt Wellington\u2019s pantry. Valancy never heard the last of those two misdemeanours. At almost every clan gathering they were raked up against her as jokes. Uncle Benjamin hardly ever missed re-telling the raspberry jam incident\u2014he had been the one to catch her, her face all stained and streaked.\n\n\u201cI have really done so few bad things that they have to keep harping on the old ones,\u201d thought Valancy. \u201cWhy, I\u2019ve never even had a quarrel with any one. I haven\u2019t an enemy. What a spineless thing I must be not to have even one enemy!\u201d\n\nThere was that incident of the dust-pile at school when she was seven. Valancy always recalled it when Dr. Stalling referred to the text, \u201cTo him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be taken even that which he hath.\u201d Other people might puzzle over that text but it never puzzled Valancy. The whole relationship between herself and Olive, dating from the day of the dust-pile, was a commentary on it.\n\nShe had been going to school a year, but Olive, who was a year younger, had just begun and had about her all the glamour of \u201ca new girl\u201d and an exceedingly pretty girl at that. It was at recess and all the girls, big and little, were out on the road in front of the school making dust-piles. The aim of each girl was to have the biggest pile. Valancy was good at making dust-piles\u2014there was an art in it\u2014and she had secret hopes of leading. But Olive, working off by herself, was suddenly discovered to have a larger dust-pile than anybody. Valancy felt no jealousy. Her dust-pile was quite big enough to please her. Then one of the older girls had an inspiration.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put all our dust on Olive\u2019s pile and make a tremendous one,\u201d she exclaimed.\n\nA frenzy seemed to seize the girls. They swooped down on the dust-piles with pails and shovels and in a few seconds Olive\u2019s pile was a veritable pyramid. In vain Valancy, with scrawny, outstretched little arms, tried to protect hers. She was ruthlessly swept aside, her dust-pile scooped up and poured on Olive\u2019s. Valancy turned away resolutely and began building another dust-pile. Again a bigger girl pounced on it. Valancy stood before it, flushed, indignant, arms outspread.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take it,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cPlease don\u2019t take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d demanded the older girl. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you help to build Olive\u2019s bigger?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want my own little dust-pile,\u201d said Valancy piteously.\n\nHer plea went unheeded. While she argued with one girl another scraped up her dust-pile. Valancy turned away, her heart swelling, her eyes full of tears.\n\n\u201cJealous\u2014you\u2019re jealous!\u201d said the girls mockingly.\n\n\u201cYou were very selfish,\u201d said her mother coldly, when Valancy told her about it at night. That was the first and last time Valancy had ever taken any of her troubles to her mother.\n\nValancy was neither jealous nor selfish. It was only that she wanted a dust-pile of her own\u2014small or big mattered not. A team of horses came down the street\u2014Olive\u2019s dust pile was scattered over the roadway\u2014the bell rang\u2014the girls trooped into school and had forgotten the whole affair before they reached their seats. Valancy never forgot it. To this day she resented it in her secret soul. But was it not symbolical of her life?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to have my own dust-pile,\u201d thought Valancy.\n\nThe enormous red moon she had seen rising right at the end of the street one autumn evening of her sixth year. She had been sick and cold with the awful, uncanny horror of it. So near to her. So big. She had run in trembling to her mother and her mother had laughed at her. She had gone to bed and hidden her face under the clothes in terror lest she might look at the window and see that horrible moon glaring in at her through it.\n\nThe boy who had tried to kiss her at a party when she was fifteen. She had not let him\u2014she had evaded him and run. He was the only boy who had ever tried to kiss her. Now, fourteen years later, Valancy found herself wishing that she had let him.\n\nThe time she had been made to apologise to Olive for something she hadn\u2019t done. Olive had said that Valancy had pushed her into the mud and spoiled her new shoes on purpose. Valancy knew she hadn\u2019t. It had been an accident\u2014and even that wasn\u2019t her fault\u2014but nobody would believe her. She had to apologise\u2014and kiss Olive to \u201cmake up.\u201d The injustice of it burned in her soul tonight.\n\nThat summer when Olive had the most beautiful hat, trimmed with creamy yellow net, with a wreath of red roses and little ribbon bows under the chin. Valancy had wanted a hat like that more than she had ever wanted anything. She pleaded for one and had been laughed at\u2014all summer she had to wear a horrid little brown sailor with elastic that cut behind her ears. None of the girls would go around with her because she was so shabby\u2014nobody but Olive. People had thought Olive so sweet and unselfish.\n\n\u201cI was an excellent foil for her,\u201d thought Valancy. \u201cEven then she knew that.\u201d\n\nValancy had tried to win a prize for attendance in Sunday School once. But Olive won it. There were so many Sundays Valancy had to stay home because she had colds. She had once tried to \u201csay a piece\u201d in school one Friday afternoon and had broken down in it. Olive was a good reciter and never got stuck.\n\nThe night she had spent in Port Lawrence with Aunt Isabel when she was ten. Byron Stirling was there; from Montreal, twelve years old, conceited, clever. At family prayers in the morning Byron had reached across and given Valancy\u2019s thin arm such a savage pinch that she screamed out with pain. After prayers were over she was summoned to Aunt Isabel\u2019s bar of judgment. But when she said Byron had pinched her Byron denied it. He said she cried out because the kitten scratched her. He said she had put the kitten up on her chair and was playing with it when she should have been listening to Uncle David\u2019s prayer. He was believed. In the Stirling clan the boys were always believed before the girls. Valancy was sent home in disgrace because of her exceedingly bad behavior during family prayers and she was not asked to Aunt Isabel\u2019s again for many moons.\n\nThe time Cousin Betty Stirling was married. Somehow Valancy got wind of the fact that Betty was going to ask her to be one of her bridesmaids. Valancy was secretly uplifted. It would be a delightful thing to be a bridesmaid. And of course she would have to have a new dress for it\u2014a pretty new dress\u2014a pink dress. Betty wanted her bridesmaids to dress in pink.\n\nBut Betty had never asked her, after all. Valancy couldn\u2019t guess why, but long after her secret tears of disappointment had been dried Olive told her. Betty, after much consultation and reflection, had decided that Valancy was too insignificant\u2014she would \u201cspoil the effect.\u201d That was nine years ago. But tonight Valancy caught her breath with the old pain and sting of it.\n\nThat day in her eleventh year when her mother had badgered her into confessing something she had never done. Valancy had denied it for a long time but eventually for peace\u2019 sake she had given in and pleaded guilty. Mrs. Frederick was always making people lie by pushing them into situations where they had to lie. Then her mother had made her kneel down on the parlour floor, between herself and Cousin Stickles, and say, \u201cO God, please forgive me for not speaking the truth.\u201d Valancy had said it, but as she rose from her knees she muttered. \u201cBut, O God, you know I did speak the truth.\u201d Valancy had not then heard of Galileo but her fate was similar to his. She was punished just as severely as if she hadn\u2019t confessed and prayed.\n\nThe winter she went to dancing-school. Uncle James had decreed she should go and had paid for her lessons. How she had looked forward to it! And how she had hated it! She had never had a voluntary partner. The teacher always had to tell some boy to dance with her, and generally he had been sulky about it. Yet Valancy was a good dancer, as light on her feet as thistledown. Olive, who never lacked eager partners, was heavy.\n\nThe affair of the button-string, when she was ten. All the girls in school had button-strings. Olive had a very long one with a great many beautiful buttons. Valancy had one. Most of the buttons on it were very commonplace, but she had six beauties that had come off Grandmother Stirling\u2019s wedding-gown\u2014sparkling buttons of gold and glass, much more beautiful than any Olive had. Their possession conferred a certain distinction on Valancy. She knew every little girl in school envied her the exclusive possession of those beautiful buttons. When Olive saw them on the button-string she had looked at them narrowly but said nothing\u2014then. The next day Aunt Wellington had come to Elm Street and told Mrs. Frederick that she thought Olive should have some of those buttons\u2014Grandmother Stirling was just as much Wellington\u2019s mother as Frederick\u2019s. Mrs. Frederick had agreed amiably. She could not afford to fall out with Aunt Wellington. Moreover, the matter was of no importance whatever. Aunt Wellington carried off four of the buttons, generously leaving two for Valancy. Valancy had torn these from her string and flung them on the floor\u2014she had not yet learned that it was unladylike to have feelings\u2014and had been sent supperless to bed for the exhibition.\n\nThe night of Margaret Blunt\u2019s party. She had made such pathetic efforts to be pretty that night. Rob Walker was to be there; and two nights before, on the moonlit verandah of Uncle Herbert\u2019s cottage at Mistawis, Rob had really seemed attracted to her. At Margaret\u2019s party Rob never even asked her to dance\u2014did not notice her at all. She was a wallflower, as usual. That, of course, was years ago. People in Deerwood had long since given up inviting Valancy to dances. But to Valancy its humiliation and disappointment were of the other day. Her face burned in the darkness as she recalled herself, sitting there with her pitifully crimped, thin hair and the cheeks she had pinched for an hour before coming, in an effort to make them red. All that came of it was a wild story that Valancy Stirling was rouged at Margaret Blunt\u2019s party. In those days in Deerwood that was enough to wreck your character forever. It did not wreck Valancy\u2019s, or even damage it. People knew she couldn\u2019t be fast if she tried. They only laughed at her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had nothing but a second-hand existence,\u201d decided Valancy. \u201cAll the great emotions of life have passed me by. I\u2019ve never even had a grief. And have I ever really loved anybody? Do I really love Mother? No, I don\u2019t. That\u2019s the truth, whether it is disgraceful or not. I don\u2019t love her\u2014I\u2019ve never loved her. What\u2019s worse, I don\u2019t even like her. So I don\u2019t know anything about any kind of love. My life has been empty\u2014empty. Nothing is worse than emptiness. Nothing!\u201d Valancy ejaculated the last \u201cnothing\u201d aloud passionately. Then she moaned and stopped thinking about anything for a while. One of her attacks of pain had come on.\n\nWhen it was over something had happened to Valancy\u2014perhaps the culmination of the process that had been going on in her mind ever since she had read Dr. Trent\u2019s letter. It was three o\u2019clock in the morning\u2014the wisest and most accursed hour of the clock. But sometimes it sets us free.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to please other people all my life and failed,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter this I shall please myself. I shall never pretend anything again. I\u2019ve breathed an atmosphere of fibs and pretences and evasions all my life. What a luxury it will be to tell the truth! I may not be able to do much that I want to do but I won\u2019t do another thing that I don\u2019t want to do. Mother can pout for weeks\u2014I shan\u2019t worry over it. \u2018Despair is a free man\u2014hope is a slave.\u2019\u201d\n\nValancy got up and dressed, with a deepening of that curious sense of freedom. When she had finished with her hair she opened the window and hurled the jar of potpourri over into the next lot. It smashed gloriously against the schoolgirl complexion on the old carriage-shop.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of the fragrance of dead things,\u201d said Valancy.\nCHAPTER IX\n\nUncle Herbert and Aunt Alberta\u2019s silver wedding was delicately referred to among the Stirlings during the following weeks as \u201cthe time we first noticed poor Valancy was\u2014a little\u2014you understand?\u201d\n\nNot for worlds would any of the Stirlings have said out and out at first that Valancy had gone mildly insane or even that her mind was slightly deranged. Uncle Benjamin was considered to have gone entirely too far when he had ejaculated, \u201cShe\u2019s dippy\u2014I tell you, she\u2019s dippy,\u201d and was only excused because of the outrageousness of Valancy\u2019s conduct at the aforesaid wedding dinner.\n\nBut Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles had noticed a few things that made them uneasy before the dinner. It had begun with the rosebush, of course; and Valancy never was really \u201cquite right\u201d again. She did not seem to worry in the least over the fact that her mother was not speaking to her. You would never suppose she noticed it at all. She had flatly refused to take either Purple Pills or Redfern\u2019s Bitters. She had announced coolly that she did not intend to answer to the name of \u201cDoss\u201d any longer. She had told Cousin Stickles that she wished she would give up wearing that brooch with Cousin Artemas Stickles\u2019 hair in it. She had moved her bed in her room to the opposite corner. She had read Magic of Wings Sunday afternoon. When Cousin Stickles had rebuked her Valancy had said indifferently, \u201cOh, I forgot it was Sunday\u201d\u2014and had gone on reading it.\n\nCousin Stickles had seen a terrible thing\u2014she had caught Valancy sliding down the bannister. Cousin Stickles did not tell Mrs. Frederick this\u2014poor Amelia was worried enough as it was. But it was Valancy\u2019s announcement on Saturday night that she was not going to go to the Anglican church any more that broke through Mrs. Frederick\u2019s stony silence.\n\n\u201cNot going to church any more! Doss, have you absolutely taken leave\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to church,\u201d said Valancy airily. \u201cI\u2019m going to the Presbyterian church. But to the Anglican church I will not go.\u201d\n\nThis was even worse. Mrs. Frederick had recourse to tears, having found outraged majesty had ceased to be effective.\n\n\u201cWhat have you got against the Anglican church?\u201d she sobbed.\n\n\u201cNothing\u2014only just that you\u2019ve always made me go there. If you\u2019d made me go to the Presbyterian church I\u2019d want to go to the Anglican.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a nice thing to say to your mother? Oh, how true it is that it is sharper than a serpent\u2019s tooth to have a thankless child.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a nice thing to say to your daughter?\u201d said unrepentant Valancy.\n\nSo Valancy\u2019s behaviour at the silver wedding was not quite the surprise to Mrs. Frederick and Christine Stickles that it was to the rest. They were doubtful about the wisdom of taking her, but concluded it would \u201cmake talk\u201d if they didn\u2019t. Perhaps she would behave herself, and so far no outsider suspected there was anything queer about her. By a special mercy of Providence it had poured torrents Sunday morning, so Valancy had not carried out her hideous threat of going to the Presbyterian church.\n\nValancy would not have cared in the least if they had left her at home. These family celebrations were all hopelessly dull. But the Stirlings always celebrated everything. It was a long-established custom. Even Mrs. Frederick gave a dinner party on her wedding anniversary and Cousin Stickles had friends in to supper on her birthday. Valancy hated these entertainments because they had to pinch and save and contrive for weeks afterwards to pay for them. But she wanted to go to the silver wedding. It would hurt Uncle Herbert\u2019s feelings if she stayed away, and she rather liked Uncle Herbert. Besides, she wanted to look over all her relatives from her new angle. It would be an excellent place to make public her declaration of independence if occasion offered.\n\n\u201cPut on your brown silk dress,\u201d said Mrs. Stirling.\n\nAs if there were anything else to put on! Valancy had only the one festive dress\u2014that snuffy-brown silk Aunt Isabel had given her. Aunt Isabel had decreed that Valancy should never wear colours. They did not become her. When she was young they allowed her to wear white, but that had been tacitly dropped for some years. Valancy put on the brown silk. It had a high collar and long sleeves. She had never had a dress with low neck and elbow sleeves, although they had been worn, even in Deerwood, for over a year. But she did not do her hair pompadour. She knotted it on her neck and pulled it out over her ears. She thought it became her\u2014only the little knot was so absurdly small. Mrs. Frederick resented the hair but decided it was wisest to say nothing on the eve of the party. It was so important that Valancy should be kept in good humour, if possible, until it was over. Mrs. Frederick did not reflect that this was the first time in her life that she had thought it necessary to consider Valancy\u2019s humours. But then Valancy had never been \u201cqueer\u201d before.\n\nOn their way to Uncle Herbert\u2019s\u2014Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles walking in front, Valancy trotting meekly along behind\u2014Roaring Abel drove past them. Drunk as usual but not in the roaring stage. Just drunk enough to be excessively polite. He raised his disreputable old tartan cap with the air of a monarch saluting his subjects and swept them a grand bow. Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles dared not cut Roaring Abel altogether. He was the only person in Deerwood who could be got to do odd jobs of carpentering and repairing when they needed to be done, so it would not do to offend him. But they responded with only the stiffest, slightest of bows. Roaring Abel must be kept in his place.\n\nValancy, behind them, did a thing they were fortunately spared seeing. She smiled gaily and waved her hand to Roaring Abel. Why not? She had always liked the old sinner. He was such a jolly, picturesque, unashamed reprobate and stood out against the drab respectability of Deerwood and its customs like a flame-red flag of revolt and protest. Only a few nights ago Abel had gone through Deerwood in the wee sma\u2019s, shouting oaths at the top of his stentorian voice which could be heard for miles, and lashing his horse into a furious gallop as he tore along prim, proper Elm Street.\n\n\u201cYelling and blaspheming like a fiend,\u201d shuddered Cousin Stickles at the breakfast-table.\n\n\u201cI cannot understand why the judgment of the Lord has not fallen upon that man long ere this,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick petulantly, as if she thought Providence was very dilatory and ought to have a gentle reminder.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be picked up dead some morning\u2014he\u2019ll fall under his horse\u2019s hoofs and be trampled to death,\u201d said Cousin Stickles reassuringly.\n\nValancy had said nothing, of course; but she wondered to herself if Roaring Abel\u2019s periodical sprees were not his futile protest against the poverty and drudgery and monotony of his existence. She went on dream sprees in her Blue Castle. Roaring Abel, having no imagination, could not do that. His escapes from reality had to be concrete. So she waved at him today with a sudden fellow feeling, and Roaring Abel, not too drunk to be astonished, nearly fell off his seat in his amazement.\n\nBy this time they had reached Maple Avenue and Uncle Herbert\u2019s house, a large, pretentious structure peppered with meaningless bay windows and excrescent porches. A house that always looked like a stupid, prosperous, self-satisfied man with warts on his face.\n\n\u201cA house like that,\u201d said Valancy solemnly, \u201cis a blasphemy.\u201d\n\nMrs. Frederick was shaken to her soul. What had Valancy said? Was it profane? Or only just queer? Mrs. Frederick took off her hat in Aunt Alberta\u2019s spare-room with trembling hands. She made one more feeble attempt to avert disaster. She held Valancy back on the landing as Cousin Stickles went downstairs.\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t you try to remember you\u2019re a lady?\u201d she pleaded.\n\n\u201cOh, if there were only any hope of being able to forget it!\u201d said Valancy wearily.\n\nMrs. Frederick felt that she had not deserved this from Providence.\nCHAPTER X\n\n\u201cBless this food to our use and consecrate our lives to Thy service,\u201d said Uncle Herbert briskly.\n\nAunt Wellington frowned. She always considered Herbert\u2019s graces entirely too short and \u201cflippant.\u201d A grace, to be a grace in Aunt Wellington\u2019s eyes, had to be at least three minutes long and uttered in an unearthly tone, between a groan and a chant. As a protest she kept her head bent a perceptible time after all the rest had been lifted. When she permitted herself to sit upright she found Valancy looking at her. Ever afterwards Aunt Wellington averred that she had known from that moment that there was something wrong with Valancy. In those queer, slanted eyes of hers\u2014\u201cwe should always have known she was not entirely right with eyes like that\u201d\u2014there was an odd gleam of mockery and amusement\u2014as if Valancy were laughing at her. Such a thing was unthinkable, of course. Aunt Wellington at once ceased to think it.\n\nValancy was enjoying herself. She had never enjoyed herself at a \u201cfamily reunion\u201d before. In social function, as in childish games, she had only \u201cfilled in.\u201d Her clan had always considered her very dull. She had no parlour tricks. And she had been in the habit of taking refuge from the boredom of family parties in her Blue Castle, which resulted in an absent-mindedness that increased her reputation for dulness and vacuity.\n\n\u201cShe has no social presence whatever,\u201d Aunt Wellington had decreed once and for all. Nobody dreamed that Valancy was dumb in their presence merely because she was afraid of them. Now she was no longer afraid of them. The shackles had been stricken off her soul. She was quite prepared to talk if occasion offered. Meanwhile she was giving herself such freedom of thought as she had never dared to take before. She let herself go with a wild, inner exultation, as Uncle Herbert carved the turkey. Uncle Herbert gave Valancy a second look that day. Being a man, he didn\u2019t know what she had done to her hair, but he thought surprisedly that Doss was not such a bad-looking girl, after all; and he put an extra piece of white meat on her plate.\n\n\u201cWhat herb is most injurious to a young lady\u2019s beauty?\u201d propounded Uncle Benjamin by way of starting conversation\u2014\u201cloosening things up a bit,\u201d as he would have said.\n\nValancy, whose duty it was to say, \u201cWhat?\u201d did not say it. Nobody else said it, so Uncle Benjamin, after an expectant pause, had to answer, \u201cThyme,\u201d and felt that his riddle had fallen flat. He looked resentfully at Valancy, who had never failed him before, but Valancy did not seem even to be aware of him. She was gazing around the table, examining relentlessly every one in this depressing assembly of sensible people and watching their little squirms with a detached, amused smile.\n\nSo these were the people she had always held in reverence and fear. She seemed to see them with new eyes.\n\nBig, capable, patronising, voluble Aunt Mildred, who thought herself the cleverest woman in the clan, her husband a little lower than the angels and her children wonders. Had not her son, Howard, been all through teething at eleven months? And could she not tell you the best way to do everything, from cooking mushrooms to picking up a snake? What a bore she was! What ugly moles she had on her face!\n\nCousin Gladys, who was always praising her son, who had died young, and always fighting with her living one. She had neuritis\u2014or what she called neuritis. It jumped about from one part of her body to another. It was a convenient thing. If anybody wanted her to go somewhere she didn\u2019t want to go she had neuritis in her legs. And always if any mental effort was required she could have neuritis in her head. You can\u2019t think with neuritis in your head, my dear.\n\n\u201cWhat an old humbug you are!\u201d thought Valancy impiously.\n\nAunt Isabel. Valancy counted her chins. Aunt Isabel was the critic of the clan. She had always gone about squashing people flat. More members of it than Valancy were afraid of her. She had, it was conceded, a biting tongue.\n\n\u201cI wonder what would happen to your face if you ever smiled,\u201d speculated Valancy, unblushingly.\n\nSecond Cousin Sarah Taylor, with her great, pale, expressionless eyes, who was noted for the variety of her pickle recipes and for nothing else. So afraid of saying something indiscreet that she never said anything worth listening to. So proper that she blushed when she saw the advertisement picture of a corset and had put a dress on her Venus de Milo statuette which made it look \u201creal tasty.\u201d\n\nLittle Cousin Georgiana. Not such a bad little soul. But dreary\u2014very. Always looking as if she had just been starched and ironed. Always afraid to let herself go. The only thing she really enjoyed was a funeral. You knew where you were with a corpse. Nothing more could happen to it. But while there was life there was fear.\n\nUncle James. Handsome, black, with his sarcastic, trap-like mouth and iron-grey side-burns, whose favourite amusement was to write controversial letters to the Christian Times, attacking Modernism. Valancy always wondered if he looked as solemn when he was asleep as he did when awake. No wonder his wife had died young. Valancy remembered her. A pretty, sensitive thing. Uncle James had denied her everything she wanted and showered on her everything she didn\u2019t want. He had killed her\u2014quite legally. She had been smothered and starved.\n\nUncle Benjamin, wheezy, pussy-mouthed. With great pouches under eyes that held nothing in reverence.\n\nUncle Wellington. Long, pallid face, thin, pale-yellow hair\u2014\u201cone of the fair Stirlings\u201d\u2014thin, stooping body, abominably high forehead with such ugly wrinkles, and \u201ceyes about as intelligent as a fish\u2019s,\u201d thought Valancy. \u201cLooks like a cartoon of himself.\u201d\n\nAunt Wellington. Named Mary but called by her husband\u2019s name to distinguish her from Great-aunt Mary. A massive, dignified, permanent lady. Splendidly arranged, iron-grey hair. Rich, fashionable beaded dress. Had her moles removed by electrolysis\u2014which Aunt Mildred thought was a wicked evasion of the purposes of God.\n\nUncle Herbert, with his spiky grey hair. Aunt Alberta, who twisted her mouth so unpleasantly in talking and had a great reputation for unselfishness because she was always giving up a lot of things she didn\u2019t want. Valancy let them off easily in her judgment because she liked them, even if they were in Milton\u2019s expressive phrase, \u201cstupidly good.\u201d But she wondered for what inscrutable reason Aunt Alberta had seen fit to tie a black velvet ribbon around each of her chubby arms above the elbow.\n\nThen she looked across the table at Olive. Olive, who had been held up to her as a paragon of beauty, behaviour and success as long as she could remember. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you hold yourself like Olive, Doss? Why can\u2019t you stand correctly like Olive, Doss? Why can\u2019t you speak prettily like Olive, Doss? Why can\u2019t you make an effort, Doss?\u201d\n\nValancy\u2019s elfin eyes lost their mocking glitter and became pensive and sorrowful. You could not ignore or disdain Olive. It was quite impossible to deny that she was beautiful and effective and sometimes she was a little intelligent. Her mouth might be a trifle heavy\u2014she might show her fine, white, regular teeth rather too lavishly when she smiled. But when all was said and done, Olive justified Uncle Benjamin\u2019s summing up\u2014\u201ca stunning girl.\u201d Yes, Valancy agreed in her heart, Olive was stunning.\n\nRich, golden-brown hair, elaborately dressed, with a sparkling bandeau holding its glossy puffs in place; large, brilliant blue eyes and thick silken lashes; face of rose and bare neck of snow, rising above her gown; great pearl bubbles in her ears; the blue-white diamond flame on her long, smooth, waxen finger with its rosy, pointed nail. Arms of marble, gleaming through green chiffon and shadow lace. Valancy felt suddenly thankful that her own scrawny arms were decently swathed in brown silk. Then she resumed her tabulation of Olive\u2019s charms.\n\nTall. Queenly. Confident. Everything that Valancy was not. Dimples, too, in cheeks and chin. \u201cA woman with dimples always gets her own way,\u201d thought Valancy, in a recurring spasm of bitterness at the fate which had denied her even one dimple.\n\nOlive was only a year younger than Valancy, though a stranger would have thought that there was at least ten years between them. But nobody ever dreaded old maidenhood for her. Olive had been surrounded by a crowd of eager beaus since her early teens, just as her mirror was always surrounded by a fringe of cards, photographs, programmes and invitations. At eighteen, when she had graduated from Havergal College, Olive had been engaged to Will Desmond, lawyer in embryo. Will Desmond had died and Olive had mourned for him properly for two years. When she was twenty-three she had a hectic affair with Donald Jackson. But Aunt and Uncle Wellington disapproved of that and in the end Olive dutifully gave him up. Nobody in the Stirling clan\u2014whatever outsiders might say\u2014hinted that she did so because Donald himself was cooling off. However that might be, Olive\u2019s third venture met with everybody\u2019s approval. Cecil Price was clever and handsome and \u201cone of the Port Lawrence Prices.\u201d Olive had been engaged to him for three years. He had just graduated in civil engineering and they were to be married as soon as he landed a contract. Olive\u2019s hope chest was full to overflowing with exquisite things and Olive had already confided to Valancy what her wedding-dress was to be. Ivory silk draped with lace, white satin court train, lined with pale green georgette, heirloom veil of Brussels lace. Valancy knew also\u2014though Olive had not told her\u2014that the bridesmaids were selected and that she was not among them.\n\nValancy had, after a fashion, always been Olive\u2019s confidante\u2014perhaps because she was the only girl in the connection who could not bore Olive with return confidences. Olive always told Valancy all the details of her love affairs, from the days when the little boys in school used to \u201cpersecute\u201d her with love letters. Valancy could not comfort herself by thinking these affairs mythical. Olive really had them. Many men had gone mad over her besides the three fortunate ones.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the poor idiots see in me, that drives them to make such double idiots of themselves,\u201d Olive was wont to say. Valancy would have liked to say, \u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d but truth and diplomacy both restrained her. She did know, perfectly well. Olive Stirling was one of the girls about whom men do go mad just as indubitably as she, Valancy, was one of the girls at whom no man ever looked twice.\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d thought Valancy, summing her up with a new and merciless conclusiveness, \u201cshe\u2019s like a dewless morning. There\u2019s something lacking.\u201d\nCHAPTER XI\n\nMeanwhile the dinner in its earlier stages was dragging its slow length along true to Stirling form. The room was chilly, in spite of the calendar, and Aunt Alberta had the gas-logs lighted. Everybody in the clan envied her those gas-logs except Valancy. Glorious open fires blazed in every room of her Blue Castle when autumnal nights were cool, but she would have frozen to death in it before she would have committed the sacrilege of a gas-log. Uncle Herbert made his hardy perennial joke when he helped Aunt Wellington to the cold meat\u2014\u201cMary, will you have a little lamb?\u201d Aunt Mildred told the same old story of once finding a lost ring in a turkey\u2019s crop. Uncle Benjamin told his favourite prosy tale of how he had once chased and punished a now famous man for stealing apples. Second Cousin Jane described all her sufferings with an ulcerating tooth. Aunt Wellington admired the pattern of Aunt Alberta\u2019s silver teaspoons and lamented the fact that one of her own had been lost.\n\n\u201cIt spoiled the set. I could never get it matched. And it was my wedding-present from dear old Aunt Matilda.\u201d\n\nAunt Isabel thought the seasons were changing and couldn\u2019t imagine what had become of our good, old-fashioned springs. Cousin Georgiana, as usual, discussed the last funeral and wondered, audibly, \u201cwhich of us will be the next to pass away.\u201d Cousin Georgiana could never say anything as blunt as \u201cdie.\u201d Valancy thought she could tell her, but didn\u2019t. Cousin Gladys, likewise as usual, had a grievance. Her visiting nephews had nipped all the buds off her house-plants and chivied her brood of fancy chickens\u2014\u201csqueezed some of them actually to death, my dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoys will be boys,\u201d reminded Uncle Herbert tolerantly.\n\n\u201cBut they needn\u2019t be ramping, rampageous animals,\u201d retorted Cousin Gladys, looking round the table for appreciation of her wit. Everybody smiled except Valancy. Cousin Gladys remembered that. A few minutes later, when Ellen Hamilton was being discussed, Cousin Gladys spoke of her as \u201cone of those shy, plain girls who can\u2019t get husbands,\u201d and glanced significantly at Valancy.\n\nUncle James thought the conversation was sagging to a rather low plane of personal gossip. He tried to elevate it by starting an abstract discussion on \u201cthe greatest happiness.\u201d Everybody was asked to state his or her idea of \u201cthe greatest happiness.\u201d\n\nAunt Mildred thought the greatest happiness\u2014for a woman\u2014was to be \u201ca loving and beloved wife and mother.\u201d Aunt Wellington thought it would be to travel in Europe. Olive thought it would be to be a great singer like Tetrazzini. Cousin Gladys remarked mournfully that her greatest happiness would be to be free\u2014absolutely free\u2014from neuritis. Cousin Georgiana\u2019s greatest happiness would be \u201cto have her dear, dead brother Richard back.\u201d Aunt Alberta remarked vaguely that the greatest happiness was to be found in \u201cthe poetry of life\u201d and hastily gave some directions to her maid to prevent any one asking her what she meant. Mrs. Frederick said the greatest happiness was to spend your life in loving service for others, and Cousin Stickles and Aunt Isabel agreed with her\u2014Aunt Isabel with a resentful air, as if she thought Mrs. Frederick had taken the wind out of her sails by saying it first. \u201cWe are all too prone,\u201d continued Mrs. Frederick, determined not to lose so good an opportunity, \u201cto live in selfishness, worldliness and sin.\u201d The other women all felt rebuked for their low ideals, and Uncle James had a conviction that the conversation had been uplifted with a vengeance.\n\n\u201cThe greatest happiness,\u201d said Valancy suddenly and distinctly, \u201cis to sneeze when you want to.\u201d\n\nEverybody stared. Nobody felt it safe to say anything. Was Valancy trying to be funny? It was incredible. Mrs. Frederick, who had been breathing easier since the dinner had progressed so far without any outbreak on the part of Valancy, began to tremble again. But she deemed it the part of prudence to say nothing. Uncle Benjamin was not so prudent. He rashly rushed in where Mrs. Frederick feared to tread.\n\n\u201cDoss,\u201d he chuckled, \u201cwhat is the difference between a young girl and an old maid?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne is happy and careless and the other is cappy and hairless,\u201d said Valancy. \u201cYou have asked that riddle at least fifty times in my recollection, Uncle Ben. Why don\u2019t you hunt up some new riddles if riddle you must? It is such a fatal mistake to try to be funny if you don\u2019t succeed.\u201d\n\nUncle Benjamin stared foolishly. Never in his life had he, Benjamin Stirling, of Stirling and Frost, been spoken to so. And by Valancy of all people! He looked feebly around the table to see what the others thought of it. Everybody was looking rather blank. Poor Mrs. Frederick had shut her eyes. And her lips moved tremblingly\u2014as if she were praying. Perhaps she was. The situation was so unprecedented that nobody knew how to meet it. Valancy went on calmly eating her salad as if nothing out of the usual had occurred.\n\nAunt Alberta, to save her dinner, plunged into an account of how a dog had bitten her recently. Uncle James, to back her up, asked where the dog had bitten her.\n\n\u201cJust a little below the Catholic church,\u201d said Aunt Alberta.\n\nAt that point Valancy laughed. Nobody else laughed. What was there to laugh at?\n\n\u201cIs that a vital part?\u201d asked Valancy.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said bewildered Aunt Alberta, and Mrs. Frederick was almost driven to believe that she had served God all her years for naught.\n\nAunt Isabel concluded that it was up to her to suppress Valancy.\n\n\u201cDoss, you are horribly thin,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are all corners. Do you ever try to fatten up a little?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Valancy was not asking quarter or giving it. \u201cBut I can tell you where you\u2019ll find a beauty parlor in Port Lawrence where they can reduce the number of your chins.\u201d\n\n\u201cVal-an-cy!\u201d The protest was wrung from Mrs. Frederick. She meant her tone to be stately and majestic, as usual, but it sounded more like an imploring whine. And she did not say \u201cDoss.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s feverish,\u201d said Cousin Stickles to Uncle Benjamin in an agonised whisper. \u201cWe\u2019ve thought she\u2019s seemed feverish for several days.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone dippy, in my opinion,\u201d growled Uncle Benjamin. \u201cIf not, she ought to be spanked. Yes, spanked.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t spank her.\u201d Cousin Stickles was much agitated. \u201cShe\u2019s twenty-nine years old.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo there is that advantage, at least, in being twenty-nine,\u201d said Valancy, whose ears had caught this aside.\n\n\u201cDoss,\u201d said Uncle Benjamin, \u201cwhen I am dead you may say what you please. As long as I am alive I demand to be treated with respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, but you know we\u2019re all dead,\u201d said Valancy, \u201cthe whole Stirling clan. Some of us are buried and some aren\u2019t\u2014yet. That is the only difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoss,\u201d said Uncle Benjamin, thinking it might cow Valancy, \u201cdo you remember the time you stole the raspberry jam?\u201d\n\nValancy flushed scarlet\u2014with suppressed laughter, not shame. She had been sure Uncle Benjamin would drag that jam in somehow.\n\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was good jam. I\u2019ve always been sorry I hadn\u2019t time to eat more of it before you found me. Oh, look at Aunt Isabel\u2019s profile on the wall. Did you ever see anything so funny?\u201d\n\nEverybody looked, including Aunt Isabel herself, which of course, destroyed it. But Uncle Herbert said kindly, \u201cI\u2014I wouldn\u2019t eat any more if I were you, Doss. It isn\u2019t that I grudge it\u2014but don\u2019t you think it would be better for yourself? Your\u2014your stomach seems a little out of order.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about my stomach, old dear,\u201d said Valancy. \u201cIt is all right. I\u2019m going to keep right on eating. It\u2019s so seldom I get the chance of a satisfying meal.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time any one had been called \u201cold dear\u201d in Deerwood. The Stirlings thought Valancy had invented the phrase and they were afraid of her from that moment. There was something so uncanny about such an expression. But in poor Mrs. Frederick\u2019s opinion the reference to a satisfying meal was the worst thing Valancy had said yet. Valancy had always been a disappointment to her. Now she was a disgrace. She thought she would have to get up and go away from the table. Yet she dared not leave Valancy there.\n\nAunt Alberta\u2019s maid came in to remove the salad plates and bring in the dessert. It was a welcome diversion. Everybody brightened up with a determination to ignore Valancy and talk as if she wasn\u2019t there. Uncle Wellington mentioned Barney Snaith. Eventually somebody did mention Barney Snaith at every Stirling function, Valancy reflected. Whatever he was, he was an individual that could not be ignored. She resigned herself to listen. There was a subtle fascination in the subject for her, though she had not yet faced this fact. She could feel her pulses beating to her finger-tips.\n\nOf course they abused him. Nobody ever had a good word to say of Barney Snaith. All the old, wild tales were canvassed\u2014the defaulting cashier-counterfeiter-infidel-murderer-in-hiding legends were thrashed out. Uncle Wellington was very indignant that such a creature should be allowed to exist at all in the neighbourhood of Deerwood. He didn\u2019t know what the police at Port Lawrence were thinking of. Everybody would be murdered in their beds some night. It was a shame that he should be allowed to be at large after all that he had done.\n\n\u201cWhat has he done?\u201d asked Valancy suddenly.\n\nUncle Wellington stared at her, forgetting that she was to be ignored.\n\n\u201cDone! Done! He\u2019s done everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat has he done?\u201d repeated Valancy inexorably. \u201cWhat do you know that he has done? You\u2019re always running him down. And what has ever been proved against him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t argue with women,\u201d said Uncle Wellington. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need proof. When a man hides himself up there on an island in Muskoka, year in and year out, and nobody can find out where he came from or how he lives, or what he does there, that\u2019s proof enough. Find a mystery and you find a crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe very idea of a man named Snaith!\u201d said Second Cousin Sarah. \u201cWhy, the name itself is enough to condemn him!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to meet him in a dark lane,\u201d shivered Cousin Georgiana.\n\n\u201cWhat do you suppose he would do to you?\u201d asked Valancy.\n\n\u201cMurder me,\u201d said Cousin Georgiana solemnly.\n\n\u201cJust for the fun of it?\u201d suggested Valancy.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Cousin Georgiana unsuspiciously. \u201cWhen there is so much smoke there must be some fire. I was afraid he was a criminal when he came here first. I felt he had something to hide. I am not often mistaken in my intuitions.\u201d\n\n\u201cCriminal! Of course he\u2019s a criminal,\u201d said Uncle Wellington. \u201cNobody doubts it\u201d\u2014glaring at Valancy. \u201cWhy, they say he served a term in the penitentiary for embezzlement. I don\u2019t doubt it. And they say he\u2019s in with that gang that are perpetrating all those bank robberies round the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho say?\u201d asked Valancy.\n\nUncle Wellington knotted his ugly forehead at her. What had got into this confounded girl, anyway? He ignored the question.\n\n\u201cHe has the identical look of a jail-bird,\u201d snapped Uncle Benjamin. \u201cI noticed it the first time I saw him.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018A fellow by the hand of nature marked, Quoted and signed to do a deed of shame\u2019,\u201d\n\ndeclaimed Uncle James. He looked enormously pleased over managing to work that quotation in at last. He had been waiting all his life for the chance.\n\n\u201cOne of his eyebrows is an arch and the other is a triangle,\u201d said Valancy. \u201cIs that why you think him so villainous?\u201d\n\nUncle James lifted his eyebrows. Generally when Uncle James lifted his eyebrows the world came to an end. This time it continued to function.\n\n\u201cHow do you know his eyebrows so well, Doss?\u201d asked Olive, a trifle maliciously. Such a remark would have covered Valancy with confusion two weeks ago, and Olive knew it.\n\n\u201cYes, how?\u201d demanded Aunt Wellington.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him twice and I looked at him closely,\u201d said Valancy composedly. \u201cI thought his face the most interesting one I ever saw.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt there is something fishy in the creature\u2019s past life,\u201d said Olive, who began to think she was decidedly out of the conversation, which had centred so amazingly around Valancy. \u201cBut he can hardly be guilty of everything he\u2019s accused of, you know.\u201d\n\nValancy felt annoyed with Olive. Why should she speak up in even this qualified defence of Barney Snaith? What had she to do with him? For that matter, what had Valancy? But Valancy did not ask herself this question.\n\n\u201cThey say he keeps dozens of cats in that hut up back on Mistawis,\u201d said Second Cousin Sarah Taylor, by way of appearing not entirely ignorant of him.\n\nCats. It sounded quite alluring to Valancy, in the plural. She pictured an island in Muskoka haunted by pussies.\n\n\u201cThat alone shows there is something wrong with him,\u201d decreed Aunt Isabel.\n\n\u201cPeople who don\u2019t like cats,\u201d said Valancy, attacking her dessert with a relish, \u201calways seem to think that there is some peculiar virtue in not liking them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man hasn\u2019t a friend except Roaring Abel,\u201d said Uncle Wellington. \u201cAnd if Roaring Abel had kept away from him, as everybody else did, it would have been better for\u2014for some members of his family.\u201d\n\nUncle Wellington\u2019s rather lame conclusion was due to a marital glance from Aunt Wellington reminding him of what he had almost forgotten\u2014that there were girls at the table.\n\n\u201cIf you mean,\u201d said Valancy passionately, \u201cthat Barney Snaith is the father of Cecily Gay\u2019s child, he isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a wicked lie.\u201d\n\nIn spite of her indignation Valancy was hugely amused at the expression of the faces around that festal table. She had not seen anything like it since the day, seventeen years ago, when at Cousin Gladys\u2019 thimble party, they discovered that she had got\u2014SOMETHING\u2014in her head at school. Lice in her head! Valancy was done with euphemisms.\n\nPoor Mrs. Frederick was almost in a state of collapse. She had believed\u2014or pretended to believe\u2014that Valancy still supposed that children were found in parsley beds.\n\n\u201cHush\u2014hush!\u201d implored Cousin Stickles.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to hush,\u201d said Valancy perversely. \u201cI\u2019ve hush\u2014hushed all my life. I\u2019ll scream if I want to. Don\u2019t make me want to. And stop talking nonsense about Barney Snaith.\u201d\n\nValancy didn\u2019t exactly understand her own indignation. What did Barney Snaith\u2019s imputed crimes and misdemeanours matter to her? And why, out of them all, did it seem most intolerable that he should have been poor, pitiful little Cecily Gay\u2019s false lover? For it did seem intolerable to her. She did not mind when they called him a thief and a counterfeiter and jail-bird; but she could not endure to think that he had loved and ruined Cecily Gay. She recalled his face on the two occasions of their chance meetings\u2014his twisted, enigmatic, engaging smile, his twinkle, his thin, sensitive, almost ascetic lips, his general air of frank daredeviltry. A man with such a smile and lips might have murdered or stolen but he could not have betrayed. She suddenly hated every one who said it or believed it of him.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a young girl I never thought or spoke about such matters, Doss,\u201d said Aunt Wellington, crushingly.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not a young girl,\u201d retorted Valancy, uncrushed. \u201cAren\u2019t you always rubbing that into me? And you are all evil-minded, senseless gossips. Can\u2019t you leave poor Cissy Gay alone? She\u2019s dying. Whatever she did, God or the Devil has punished her enough for it. You needn\u2019t take a hand, too. As for Barney Snaith, the only crime he has been guilty of is living to himself and minding his own business. He can, it seems, get along without you. Which is an unpardonable sin, of course, in your little snobocracy.\u201d Valancy coined that concluding word suddenly and felt that it was an inspiration. That was exactly what they were and not one of them was fit to mend another.\n\n\u201cValancy, your poor father would turn over in his grave if he could hear you,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick.\n\n\u201cI dare say he would like that for a change,\u201d said Valancy brazenly.\n\n\u201cDoss,\u201d said Uncle James heavily, \u201cthe Ten Commandments are fairly up to date still\u2014especially the fifth. Have you forgotten that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Valancy, \u201cbut I thought you had\u2014especially the ninth. Have you ever thought, Uncle James, how dull life would be without the Ten Commandments? It is only when things are forbidden that they become fascinating.\u201d\n\nBut her excitement had been too much for her. She knew, by certain unmistakable warnings, that one of her attacks of pain was coming on. It must not find her there. She rose from her chair.\n\n\u201cI am going home now. I only came for the dinner. It was very good, Aunt Alberta, although your salad-dressing is not salt enough and a dash of cayenne would improve it.\u201d\n\nNone of the flabbergasted silver wedding guests could think of anything to say until the lawn gate clanged behind Valancy in the dusk. Then\u2014\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s feverish\u2014I\u2019ve said right along she was feverish,\u201d moaned Cousin Stickles.\n\nUncle Benjamin punished his pudgy left hand fiercely with his pudgy right.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s dippy\u2014I tell you she\u2019s gone dippy,\u201d he snorted angrily. \u201cThat\u2019s all there is about it. Clean dippy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Benjamin,\u201d said Cousin Georgiana soothingly, \u201cdon\u2019t condemn her too rashly. We must remember what dear old Shakespeare says\u2014that charity thinketh no evil.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharity! Poppy-cock!\u201d snorted Uncle Benjamin. \u201cI never heard a young woman talk such stuff in my life as she just did. Talking about things she ought to be ashamed to think of, much less mention. Blaspheming! Insulting us! What she wants is a generous dose of spank-weed and I\u2019d like to be the one to administer it. H-uh-h-h-h!\u201d Uncle Benjamin gulped down the half of a scalding cup of coffee.\n\n\u201cDo you suppose that the mumps could work on a person that way?\u201d wailed Cousin Stickles.\n\n\u201cI opened an umbrella in the house yesterday,\u201d sniffed Cousin Georgiana. \u201cI knew it betokened some misfortune.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you tried to find out if she has a temperature?\u201d asked Cousin Mildred.\n\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t let Amelia put the thermometer under her tongue,\u201d whimpered Cousin Stickles.\n\nMrs. Frederick was openly in tears. All her defences were down.\n\n\u201cI must tell you,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cthat Valancy has been acting very strangely for over two weeks now. She hasn\u2019t been a bit like herself\u2014Christine could tell you. I have hoped against hope that it was only one of her colds coming on. But it is\u2014it must be something worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is bringing on my neuritis again,\u201d said Cousin Gladys, putting her hand to her head.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Amelia,\u201d said Herbert kindly, pulling nervously at his spiky grey hair. He hated \u201cfamily ructions.\u201d Very inconsiderate of Doss to start one at his silver wedding. Who could have supposed she had it in her? \u201cYou\u2019ll have to take her to a doctor. This may be only a\u2014er\u2014a brainstorm. There are such things as brainstorms nowadays, aren\u2019t there?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014I suggested consulting a doctor to her yesterday,\u201d moaned Mrs. Frederick. \u201cAnd she said she wouldn\u2019t go to a doctor\u2014wouldn\u2019t. Oh, surely I have had trouble enough!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she won\u2019t take Redfern\u2019s Bitters,\u201d said Cousin Stickles.\n\n\u201cOr anything,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick.\n\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s determined to go to the Presbyterian church,\u201d said Cousin Stickles\u2014repressing, however, to her credit be it said, the story of the bannister.\n\n\u201cThat proves she\u2019s dippy,\u201d growled Uncle Benjamin. \u201cI noticed something strange about her the minute she came in today. I noticed it before today.\u201d (Uncle Benjamin was thinking of \u201cm-i-r-a-z-h.\u201d) \u201cEverything she said today showed an unbalanced mind. That question\u2014\u2018Was it a vital part?\u2019 Was there any sense at all in that remark? None whatever! There never was anything like that in the Stirlings. It must be from the Wansbarras.\u201d\n\nPoor Mrs. Frederick was too crushed to be indignant.\n\n\u201cI never heard of anything like that in the Wansbarras,\u201d she sobbed.\n\n\u201cYour father was odd enough,\u201d said Uncle Benjamin.\n\n\u201cPoor Pa was\u2014peculiar,\u201d admitted Mrs. Frederick tearfully, \u201cbut his mind was never affected.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe talked all his life exactly as Valancy did today,\u201d retorted Uncle Benjamin. \u201cAnd he believed he was his own great-great grandfather born over again. I\u2019ve heard him say it. Don\u2019t tell me that a man who believed a thing like that was ever in his right senses. Come, come, Amelia, stop sniffling. Of course Doss has made a terrible exhibition of herself today, but she\u2019s not responsible. Old maids are apt to fly off at a tangent like that. If she had been married when she should have been she wouldn\u2019t have got like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody wanted to marry her,\u201d said Mrs. Frederick, who felt that, somehow, Uncle Benjamin was blaming her.\n\n\u201cWell, fortunately there\u2019s no outsider here,\u201d snapped Uncle Benjamin. \u201cWe may keep it in the family yet. I\u2019ll take her over to see Dr. Marsh tomorrow. I know how to deal with pig-headed people. Won\u2019t that be best, James?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must have medical advice certainly,\u201d agreed Uncle James.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s settled. In the meantime, Amelia, act as if nothing had happened and keep an eye on her. Don\u2019t let her be alone. Above all, don\u2019t let her sleep alone.\u201d\n\nRenewed whimpers from Mrs. Frederick.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it. Night before last I suggested she\u2019d better have Christine sleep with her. She positively refused\u2014and locked her door. Oh, you don\u2019t know how she\u2019s changed. She won\u2019t work. At least, she won\u2019t sew. She does her usual housework, of course. But she wouldn\u2019t sweep the parlour yesterday morning, though we always sweep it on Thursdays. She said she\u2019d wait till it was dirty. \u2018Would you rather sweep a dirty room than a clean one?\u2019 I asked her. She said, \u2018Of course. I\u2019d see something for my labour then.\u2019 Think of it!\u201d\n\nUncle Benjamin thought of it.\n\n\u201cThe jar of potpourri\u201d\u2014Cousin Stickles pronounced it as spelled\u2014\u201chas disappeared from her room. I found the pieces in the next lot. She won\u2019t tell us what happened to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should never have dreamed it of Doss,\u201d said Uncle Herbert. \u201cShe has always seemed such a quiet, sensible girl. A bit backward\u2014but sensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only thing you can be sure of in this world is the multiplication table,\u201d said Uncle James, feeling cleverer than ever.\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s cheer up,\u201d suggested Uncle Benjamin. \u201cWhy are chorus girls like fine stock raisers?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Cousin Stickles, since it had to be asked and Valancy wasn\u2019t there to ask it.\n\n\u201cLike to exhibit calves,\u201d chuckled Uncle Benjamin.\n\nCousin Stickles thought Uncle Benjamin a little indelicate. Before Olive, too. But then, he was a man.\n\nUncle Herbert was thinking that things were rather dull now that Doss had gone.\nCHAPTER XII\n\nValancy hurried home through the faint blue twilight\u2014hurried too fast perhaps. The attack she had when she thankfully reached the shelter of her own room was the worst yet. It was really very bad. She might die in one of those spells. It would be dreadful to die in such pain. Perhaps\u2014perhaps this was death. Valancy felt pitifully alone. When she could think at all she wondered what it would be like to have some one with her who could sympathise\u2014some one who really cared\u2014just to hold her hand tight, if nothing else\u2014some one just to say, \u201cYes, I know. It\u2019s dreadful\u2014be brave\u2014you\u2019ll soon be better;\u201d not some one merely fussy and alarmed. Not her mother or Cousin Stickles. Why did the thought of Barney Snaith come into her mind? Why did she suddenly feel, in the midst of this hideous loneliness of pain, that he would be sympathetic\u2014sorry for any one that was suffering? Why did he seem to her like an old, well-known friend? Was it because she had been defending him\u2014standing up to her family for him?\n\nShe was so bad at first that she could not even get herself a dose of Dr. Trent\u2019s prescription. But eventually she managed it, and soon after relief came. The pain left her and she lay on her bed, spent, exhausted, in a cold perspiration. Oh, that had been horrible! She could not endure many more attacks like that. One didn\u2019t mind dying if death could be instant and painless. But to be hurt so in dying!\n\nSuddenly she found herself laughing. That dinner had been fun. And it had all been so simple. She had merely said the things she had always thought. Their faces\u2014oh, their faces! Uncle Benjamin\u2014poor, flabbergasted Uncle Benjamin! Valancy felt quite sure he would make a new will that very night. Olive would get Valancy\u2019s share of his fat hoard. Olive had always got Valancy\u2019s share of everything. Remember the dust-pile.\n\nTo laugh at her clan as she had always wanted to laugh was all the satisfaction she could get out of life now. But she thought it was rather pitiful that it should be so. Might she not pity herself a little when nobody else did?\n\nValancy got up and went to her window. The moist, beautiful wind blowing across groves of young-leafed wild trees touched her face with the caress of a wise, tender, old friend. The lombardies in Mrs. Tredgold\u2019s lawn, off to the left\u2014Valancy could just see them between the stable and the old carriage-shop\u2014were in dark purple silhouette against a clear sky and there was a milk-white, pulsating star just over one of them, like a living pearl on a silver-green lake. Far beyond the station were the shadowy, purple-hooded woods around Lake Mistawis. A white, filmy mist hung over them and just above it was a faint, young crescent. Valancy looked at it over her thin left shoulder.\n\n\u201cI wish,\u201d she said whimsically, \u201cthat I may have one little dust-pile before I die.\u201d\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nUncle Benjamin found he had reckoned without his host when he promised so airily to take Valancy to a doctor. Valancy would not go. Valancy laughed in his face.\n\n\u201cWhy on earth should I go to Dr. Marsh? There\u2019s nothing the matter with my mind. Though you all think I\u2019ve suddenly gone crazy. Well, I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve simply grown tired of living to please other people and have decided to please myself. It will give you something to talk about besides my stealing the raspberry jam. So that\u2019s that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoss,\u201d said Uncle Benjamin, solemnly and helplessly, \u201cyou are not\u2014like yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho am I like, then?\u201d asked Valancy.\n\nUncle Benjamin was rather posed.\n\n\u201cYour Grandfather Wansbarra,\u201d he answered desperately.\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Valancy looked pleased. \u201cThat\u2019s a real compliment. I remember Grandfather Wansbarra. He was one of the few human beings I have known\u2014almost the only one. Now, it is of no use to scold or entreat or command, Uncle Benjamin\u2014or exchange anguished glances with Mother and Cousin Stickles. I am not going to any doctor. And if you bring any doctor here I won\u2019t see him. So what are you going to do about it?\u201d\n\nWhat indeed! It was not seemly\u2014or even possible\u2014to hale Valancy doctorwards by physical force. And in no other way could it be done, seemingly. Her mother\u2019s tears and imploring entreaties availed not.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mother,\u201d said Valancy, lightly but quite respectfully. \u201cIt isn\u2019t likely I\u2019ll do anything very terrible. But I mean to have a little fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cFun!\u201d Mrs. Frederick uttered the word as if Valancy had said she was going to have a little tuberculosis.\n\nOlive, sent by her mother to see if she had any influence over Valancy, came away with flushed cheeks and angry eyes. She told her mother that nothing could be done with Valancy. After she, Olive, had talked to her just like a sister, tenderly and wisely, all Valancy had said, narrowing her funny eyes to mere slips, was, \u201cI don\u2019t show my gums when I laugh.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore as if she were talking to herself than to me. Indeed, Mother, all the time I was talking to her she gave me the impression of not really listening. And that wasn\u2019t all. When I finally decided that what I was saying had no influence over her I begged her, when Cecil came next week, not to say anything queer before him, at least. Mother, what do you think she said?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I can\u2019t imagine,\u201d groaned Aunt Wellington, prepared for anything.\n"},{title:"The Enchanted April",author:"Elizabeth Von Arnim",gender:"Female",text:"It began in a Woman\u2019s Club in London on a February afternoon\u2014an uncomfortable club, and a miserable afternoon\u2014when Mrs. Wilkins, who had come down from Hampstead to shop and had lunched at her club, took up The Times from the table in the smoking-room, and running her listless eye down the Agony Column saw this:\nTo Those who Appreciate Wistaria and Sunshine. Small mediaeval Italian Castle on the shores of the Mediterranean to be Let Furnished for the month of April. Necessary servants remain. Z, Box 1000, The Times.\n\nThat was its conception; yet, as in the case of many another, the conceiver was unaware of it at the moment.\n\nSo entirely unaware was Mrs. Wilkins that her April for that year had then and there been settled for her that she dropped the newspaper with a gesture that was both irritated and resigned, and went over to the window and stared drearily out at the dripping street.\n\nNot for her were mediaeval castles, even those that are specially described as small. Not for her the shores in April of the Mediterranean, and the wistaria and sunshine. Such delights were only for the rich. Yet the advertisement had been addressed to persons who appreciate these things, so that it had been, anyhow, addressed too to her, for she certainly appreciated them; more than anybody knew; more than she had ever told. But she was poor. In the whole world she possessed of her very own only ninety pounds, saved from year to year, put by carefully pound by pound, out of her dress allowance. She had scraped this sum together at the suggestion of her husband as a shield and refuge against a rainy day. Her dress allowance, given her by her father, was \xa3100 a year, so that Mrs. Wilkins\u2019s clothes were what her husband, urging her to save, called modest and becoming, and her acquaintance to each other, when they spoke of her at all, which was seldom for she was very negligible, called a perfect sight.\n\nMr. Wilkins, a solicitor, encouraged thrift, except that branch of it which got into his food. He did not call that thrift, he called it bad housekeeping. But for the thrift which, like moth, penetrated into Mrs. Wilkins\u2019s clothes and spoilt them, he had much praise. \u201cYou never know,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen there will be a rainy day, and you may be very glad to find you have a nest-egg. Indeed we both may.\u201d\n\nLooking out of the club window into Shaftesbury Avenue\u2014hers was an economical club, but convenient for Hampstead, where she lived, and for Shoolbred\u2019s, where she shopped\u2014Mrs. Wilkins, having stood there some time very drearily, her mind\u2019s eye on the Mediterranean in April, and the wistaria, and the enviable opportunities of the rich, while her bodily eye watched the really extremely horrible sooty rain falling steadily on the hurrying umbrellas and splashing omnibuses, suddenly wondered whether perhaps this was not the rainy day Mellersh\u2014Mellersh was Mr. Wilkins\u2014had so often encouraged her to prepare for, and whether to get out of such a climate and into the small mediaeval castle wasn\u2019t perhaps what Providence had all along intended her to do with her savings. Part of her savings, of course; perhaps quite a small part. The castle, being mediaeval, might also be dilapidated, and dilapidations were surely cheap. She wouldn\u2019t in the least mind a few of them, because you didn\u2019t pay for dilapidations which were already there; on the contrary\u2014by reducing the price you had to pay they really paid you. But what nonsense to think of it . . .\n\nShe turned away from the window with the same gesture of mingled irritation and resignation with which she had laid down The Times, and crossed the room towards the door with the intention of getting her mackintosh and umbrella and fighting her way into one of the overcrowded omnibuses and going to Shoolbred\u2019s on her way home and buying some soles for Mellersh\u2019s dinner\u2014Mellersh was difficult with fish and liked only soles, except salmon\u2014when she beheld Mrs. Arbuthnot, a woman she knew by sight as also living in Hampstead and belonging to the club, sitting at the table in the middle of the room on which the newspapers and magazines were kept, absorbed, in her turn, in the first page of The Times.\n\nMrs. Wilkins had never yet spoken to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who belonged to one of the various church sets, and who analysed, classified, divided and registered the poor; whereas she and Mellersh, when they did go out, went to the parties of impressionist painters, of whom in Hampstead there were many. Mellersh had a sister who had married one of them and lived up on the Heath, and because of this alliance Mrs. Wilkins was drawn into a circle which was highly unnatural to her, and she had learned to dread pictures. She had to say things about them, and she didn\u2019t know what to say. She used to murmur, \u201cMarvellous,\u201d and feel that it was not enough. But nobody minded. Nobody listened. Nobody took any notice of Mrs. Wilkins. She was the kind of person who is not noticed at parties. Her clothes, infested by thrift, made her practically invisible; her face was non-arresting; her conversation was reluctant; she was shy. And if one\u2019s clothes and face and conversation are all negligible, thought Mrs. Wilkins, who recognised her disabilities, what, at parties, is there left of one?\n\nAlso she was always with Wilkins, that clean-shaven, fine-looking man, who gave a party, merely by coming to it, a great air. Wilkins was very respectable. He was known to be highly thought of by his senior partners. His sister\u2019s circle admired him. He pronounced adequately intelligent judgments on art and artists. He was pithy; he was prudent; he never said a word too much, nor, on the other hand, did he ever say a word too little. He produced the impression of keeping copies of everything he said; and he was so obviously reliable that it often happened that people who met him at these parties became discontented with their own solicitors, and after a period of restlessness extricated themselves and went to Wilkins.\n\nNaturally Mrs. Wilkins was blotted out. \u201cShe,\u201d said his sister, with something herself of the judicial, the digested, and the final in her manner, \u201cshould stay at home.\u201d But Wilkins could not leave his wife at home. He was a family solicitor, and all such have wives and show them. With his in the week he went to parties, and with his on Sundays he went to church. Being still fairly young\u2014he was thirty-nine\u2014and ambitious of old ladies, of whom he had not yet acquired in his practice a sufficient number, he could not afford to miss church, and it was there that Mrs. Wilkins became familiar, though never through words, with Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\nShe saw her marshalling the children of the poor into pews. She would come in at the head of the procession from the Sunday School exactly five minutes before the choir, and get her boys and girls neatly fitted into their allotted seats, and down on their little knees in their preliminary prayer, and up again on their feet just as, to the swelling organ, the vestry door opened, and the choir and clergy, big with the litanies and commandments they were presently to roll out, emerged. She had a sad face, yet she was evidently efficient. The combination used to make Mrs. Wilkins wonder, for she had been told by Mellersh, on days when she had only been able to get plaice, that if one were efficient one wouldn\u2019t be depressed, and that if one does one\u2019s job well one becomes automatically bright and brisk.\n\nAbout Mrs. Arbuthnot there was nothing bright and brisk, though much in her way with the Sunday School children that was automatic; but when Mrs. Wilkins, turning from the window, caught sight of her in the club she was not being automatic at all, but was looking fixedly at one portion of the first page of The Times, holding the paper quite still, her eyes not moving. She was just staring; and her face, as usual, was the face of a patient and disappointed Madonna.\n\nObeying an impulse she wondered at even while obeying it, Mrs. Wilkins, the shy and the reluctant, instead of proceeding as she had intended to the cloakroom and from thence to Schoolbred\u2019s in search of Mellersh\u2019s fish, stopped at the table and sat down exactly opposite Mrs. Arbuthnot, to whom she had never yet spoken in her life.\n\nIt was one of those long, narrow refectory tables, so that they were quite close to each other.\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot, however, did not look up. She continued to gaze, with eyes that seemed to be dreaming, at one spot only of The Times.\n\nMrs. Wilkins watched her a minute, trying to screw up courage to speak to her. She wanted to ask her if she had seen the advertisement. She did not know why she wanted to ask her this, but she wanted to. How stupid not to be able to speak to her. She looked so kind. She looked so unhappy. Why couldn\u2019t two unhappy people refresh each other on their way through this dusty business of life by a little talk\u2014real, natural talk, about what they felt, what they would have liked, what they still tried to hope? And she could not help thinking that Mrs. Arbuthnot, too, was reading that very same advertisement. Her eyes were on the very part of the paper. Was she, too, picturing what it would be like\u2014the colour, the fragrance, the light, the soft lapping of the sea among little hot rocks? Colour, fragrance, light, sea; instead of Shaftesbury Avenue, and the wet omnibuses, and the fish department at Shoolbred\u2019s, and the Tube to Hampstead, and dinner, and to-morrow the same and the day after the same and always the same . . .\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Wilkins found herself leaning across the table. \u201cAre you reading about the mediaeval castle and the wistaria?\u201d she heard herself asking.\n\nNaturally Mrs. Arbuthnot was surprised; but she was not half so much surprised as Mrs. Wilkins was at herself for asking.\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot had not yet to her knowledge set eyes on the shabby, lank, loosely-put-together figure sitting opposite her, with its small freckled face and big grey eyes almost disappearing under a smashed-down wet-weather hat, and she gazed at her a moment without answering. She was reading about the mediaeval castle and the wistaria, or rather had read about it ten minutes before, and since then had been lost in dreams\u2014of light, of colour, of fragrance, of the soft lapping of the sea among little hot rocks . . .\n\n\u201cWhy do you ask me that?\u201d she said in her grave voice, for her training of and by the poor had made her grave and patient.\n\nMrs. Wilkins flushed and looked excessively shy and frightened. \u201cOh, only because I saw it too, and I thought perhaps\u2014I thought somehow\u2014\u201d she stammered.\n\nWhereupon Mrs. Arbuthnot, her mind being used to getting people into lists and divisions, from habit considered, as she gazed thoughtfully at Mrs. Wilkins, under what heading, supposing she had to classify her, she could most properly be put.\n\n\u201cAnd I know you by sight,\u201d went on Mrs. Wilkins, who, like all the shy, once she was started plunged on, frightening herself to more and more speech by the sheer sound of what she had said last in her ears. \u201cEvery Sunday\u2014I see you every Sunday in church\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIn church?\u201d echoed Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\u201cAnd this seems such a wonderful thing\u2014this advertisement about the wistaria\u2014and\u2014\u201d\n\nMrs. Wilkins, who must have been at least thirty, broke off and wriggled in her chair with the movement of an awkward and embarrassed schoolgirl.\n\n\u201cIt seems so wonderful,\u201d she went on in a kind of burst, \u201cand\u2014it is such a miserable day . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then she sat looking at Mrs. Arbuthnot with the eyes of an imprisoned dog.\n\n\u201cThis poor thing,\u201d thought Mrs. Arbuthnot, whose life was spent in helping and alleviating, \u201cneeds advice.\u201d\n\nShe accordingly prepared herself patiently to give it.\n\n\u201cIf you see me in church,\u201d she said, kindly and attentively, \u201cI suppose you live in Hampstead too?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins. And she repeated, her head on its long thin neck drooping a little as if the recollection of Hampstead bowed her, \u201cOh yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d asked Mrs. Arbuthnot, who, when advice was needed, naturally first proceeded to collect the facts.\n\nBut Mrs. Wilkins, laying her hand softly and caressingly on the part of The Times where the advertisement was, as though the mere printed words of it were precious, only said, \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s why this seems so wonderful.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014I think that\u2019s wonderful anyhow,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot, forgetting facts and faintly sighing.\n\n\u201cThen you were reading it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot, her eyes going dreamy again.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful?\u201d murmured Mrs. Wilkins.\n\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot. Her face, which had lit up, faded into patience again. \u201cVery wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s no use wasting one\u2019s time thinking of such things.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, but it is,\u201d was Mrs. Wilkins\u2019s quick, surprising reply; surprising because it was so much unlike the rest of her\u2014the characterless coat and skirt, the crumpled hat, the undecided wisp of hair straggling out. \u201cAnd just the considering of them is worth while in itself\u2014such a change from Hampstead\u2014and sometimes I believe\u2014I really do believe\u2014if one considers hard enough one gets things.\u201d\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot observed her patiently. In what category would she, supposing she had to, put her?\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said, leaning forward a little, \u201cyou will tell me your name. If we are to be friends\u201d\u2014she smiled her grave smile\u2014\u201cas I hope we are, we had better begin at the beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes\u2014how kind of you. I\u2019m Mrs. Wilkins,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins. \u201cI don\u2019t expect,\u201d she added, flushing, as Mrs. Arbuthnot said nothing, \u201cthat it conveys anything to you. Sometimes it\u2014it doesn\u2019t seem to convey anything to me either. But\u201d\u2014she looked round with a movement of seeking help\u2014\u201cI am Mrs. Wilkins.\u201d\n\nShe did not like her name. It was a mean, small name, with a kind of facetious twist, she thought, about its end like the upward curve of a pugdog\u2019s tail. There it was, however. There was no doing anything with it. Wilkins she was and Wilkins she would remain; and though her husband encouraged her to give it on all occasions as Mrs. Mellersh-Wilkins she only did that when he was within earshot, for she thought Mellersh made Wilkins worse, emphasising it in the way Chatsworth on the gate-posts of a villa emphasises the villa.\n\nWhen first he suggested she should add Mellersh she had objected for the above reason, and after a pause\u2014Mellersh was much too prudent to speak except after a pause, during which presumably he was taking a careful mental copy of his coming observation\u2014he said, much displeased, \u201cBut I am not a villa,\u201d and looked at her as he looks who hopes, for perhaps the hundredth time, that he may not have married a fool.\n\nOf course he was not a villa, Mrs. Wilkins assured him; she had never supposed he was; she had not dreamed of meaning . . . she was only just thinking . . .\n\nThe more she explained the more earnest became Mellersh\u2019s hope, familiar to him by this time, for he had then been a husband for two years, that he might not by any chance have married a fool; and they had a prolonged quarrel, if that can be called a quarrel which is conducted with dignified silence on one side and earnest apology on the other, as to whether or no Mrs. Wilkins had intended to suggest that Mr. Wilkins was a villa.\n\n\u201cI believe,\u201d she had thought when it was at last over\u2014it took a long while\u2014\u201cthat anybody would quarrel about anything when they\u2019ve not left off being together for a single day for two whole years. What we both need is a holiday.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy husband,\u201d went on Mrs. Wilkins to Mrs. Arbuthnot, trying to throw some light on herself, \u201cis a solicitor. He\u2014\u201d She cast about for something she could say elucidatory of Mellersh, and found: \u201cHe\u2019s very handsome.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot kindly, \u201cthat must be a great pleasure to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Mrs. Wilkins.\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot, a little taken aback, for constant intercourse with the poor had accustomed her to have her pronouncements accepted without question, \u201cbecause beauty\u2014handsomeness\u2014is a gift like any other, and if it is properly used\u2014\u201d\n\nShe trailed off into silence. Mrs. Wilkins\u2019s great grey eyes were fixed on her, and it seemed suddenly to Mrs. Arbuthnot that perhaps she was becoming crystallised into a habit of exposition, and of exposition after the manner of nursemaids, through having an audience that couldn\u2019t but agree, that would be afraid, if it wished, to interrupt, that didn\u2019t know, that was, in fact, at her mercy.\n\nBut Mrs. Wilkins was not listening; for just then, absurd as it seemed, a picture had flashed across her brain, and there were two figures in it sitting together under a great trailing wistaria that stretched across the branches of a tree she didn\u2019t know, and it was herself and Mrs. Arbuthnot\u2014she saw them\u2014she saw them. And behind them, bright in sunshine, were old grey walls\u2014the mediaeval castle\u2014she saw it\u2014they were there . . .\n\nShe therefore stared at Mrs. Arbuthnot and did not hear a word she said. And Mrs. Arbuthnot stared too at Mrs. Wilkins, arrested by the expression on her face, which was swept by the excitement of what she saw, and was as luminous and tremulous under it as water in sunlight when it is ruffled by a gust of wind. At this moment, if she had been at a party, Mrs. Wilkins would have been looked at with interest.\n\nThey stared at each other; Mrs. Arbuthnot surprised, inquiringly, Mrs. Wilkins with the eyes of some one who has had a revelation. Of course. That was how it could be done. She herself, she by herself, couldn\u2019t afford it, and wouldn\u2019t be able, even if she could afford it, to go there all alone; but she and Mrs. Arbuthnot together . . .\n\nShe leaned across the table. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we try and get it?\u201d she whispered.\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot became even more wide-eyed. \u201cGet it?\u201d she repeated.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, still as though she were afraid of being overheard. \u201cNot just sit here and say How wonderful, and then go home to Hampstead without having put out a finger\u2014go home just as usual and see about the dinner and the fish just as we\u2019ve been doing for years and years and will go on doing for years and years. In fact,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, flushing to the roots of her hair, for the sound of what she was saying, of what was coming pouring out, frightened her, and yet she couldn\u2019t stop, \u201cI see no end to it. There is no end to it. So that there ought to be a break, there ought to be intervals\u2014in everybody\u2019s interests. Why, it would really be being unselfish to go away and be happy for a little, because we would come back so much nicer. You see, after a bit everybody needs a holiday.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014how do you mean, get it?\u201d asked Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\u201cTake it,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins.\n\n\u201cTake it?\u201d\n\n\u201cRent it. Hire it. Have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014do you mean you and I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Between us. Share. Then it would only cost half, and you look so\u2014you look exactly as if you wanted it just as much as I do\u2014as if you ought to have a rest\u2014have something happy happen to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, but we don\u2019t know each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut just think how well we would if we went away together for a month! And I\u2019ve saved for a rainy day, and I expect so have you, and this is the rainy day\u2014look at it\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is unbalanced,\u201d thought Mrs. Arbuthnot; yet she felt strangely stirred.\n\n\u201cThink of getting away for a whole month\u2014from everything\u2014to heaven\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t say things like that,\u201d thought Mrs. Arbuthnot. \u201cThe vicar\u2014\u201d Yet she felt strangely stirred. It would indeed be wonderful to have a rest, a cessation.\n\nHabit, however, steadied her again; and years of intercourse with the poor made her say, with the slight though sympathetic superiority of the explainer, \u201cBut then, you see, heaven isn\u2019t somewhere else. It is here and now. We are told so.\u201d\n\nShe became very earnest, just as she did when trying patiently to help and enlighten the poor. \u201cHeaven is within us,\u201d she said in her gentle low voice. \u201cWe are told that on the very highest authority. And you know the lines about the kindred points, don\u2019t you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, I know them,\u201d interrupted Mrs. Wilkins impatiently.\n\n\u201cThe kindred points of heaven and home,\u201d continued Mrs. Arbuthnot, who was used to finishing her sentences. \u201cHeaven is in our home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, again surprisingly.\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot was taken aback. Then she said gently, \u201cOh, but it is. It is there if we choose, if we make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do choose, and I do make it, and it isn\u2019t,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins.\n\nThen Mrs. Arbuthnot was silent, for she too sometimes had doubts about homes. She sat and looked uneasily at Mrs. Wilkins, feeling more and more the urgent need to getting her classified. If she could only classify Mrs. Wilkins, get her safely under her proper heading, she felt that she herself would regain her balance, which did seem very strangely to be slipping all to one side. For neither had she had a holiday for years, and the advertisement when she saw it had set her dreaming, and Mrs. Wilkins\u2019s excitement about it was infectious, and she had the sensation, as she listened to her impetuous, odd talk and watched her lit-up face, that she was being stirred out of sleep.\n\nClearly Mrs. Wilkins was unbalanced, but Mrs. Arbuthnot had met the unbalanced before\u2014indeed she was always meeting them\u2014and they had no effect on her own stability at all; whereas this one was making her feel quite wobbly, quite as though to be off and away, away from her compass points of God, Husband, Home and Duty\u2014she didn\u2019t feel as if Mrs. Wilkins intended Mr. Wilkins to come too\u2014and just for once be happy, would be both good and desirable. Which of course it wasn\u2019t; which certainly of course it wasn\u2019t. She, also, had a nest-egg, invested gradually in the Post Office Savings Bank, but to suppose that she would ever forget her duty to the extent of drawing it out and spending it on herself was surely absurd. Surely she couldn\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t ever do such a thing? Surely she wouldn\u2019t, she couldn\u2019t ever forget her poor, forget misery and sickness as completely as that? No doubt a trip to Italy would be extraordinarily delightful, but there were many delightful things one would like to do, and what was strength given to one for except to help one not to do them?\n\nSteadfast as the points of the compass to Mrs. Arbuthnot were the great four facts of life: God, Husband, Home, Duty. She had gone to sleep on these facts years ago, after a period of much misery, her head resting on them as on a pillow; and she had a great dread of being awakened out of so simple and untroublesome a condition. Therefore it was that she searched with earnestness for a heading under which to put Mrs. Wilkins, and in this way illumine and steady her own mind; and sitting there looking at her uneasily after her last remark, and feeling herself becoming more and more unbalanced and infected, she decided pro tem, as the vicar said at meetings, to put her under the heading Nerves. It was just possible that she ought to go straight into the category Hysteria, which was often only the antechamber to Lunacy, but Mrs. Arbuthnot had learned not to hurry people into their final categories, having on more than one occasion discovered with dismay that she had made a mistake; and how difficult it had been to get them out again, and how crushed she had been with the most terrible remorse.\n\nYes. Nerves. Probably she had no regular work for others, thought Mrs. Arbuthnot; no work that would take her outside herself. Evidently she was rudderless\u2014blown about by gusts, by impulses. Nerves was almost certainly her category, or would be quite soon if no one helped her. Poor little thing, thought Mrs. Arbuthnot, her own balance returning hand in hand with her compassion, and unable, because of the table, to see the length of Mrs. Wilkins\u2019s legs. All she saw was her small, eager, shy face, and her thin shoulders, and the look of childish longing in her eyes for something that she was sure was going to make her happy. No; such things didn\u2019t make people happy, such fleeting things. Mrs. Arbuthnot had learned in her long life with Frederick\u2014he was her husband, and she had married him at twenty and was now thirty-three\u2014where alone true joys are to be found. They are to be found, she now knew, only in daily, in hourly, living for others; they are to be found only\u2014hadn\u2019t she over and over again taken her disappointments and discouragements there, and come away comforted?\u2014at the feet of God.\n\nFrederick had been the kind of husband whose wife betakes herself early to the feet of God. From him to them had been a short though painful step. It seemed short to her in retrospect, but it had really taken the whole of the first year of their marriage, and every inch of the way had been a struggle, and every inch of it was stained, she felt at the time, with her heart\u2019s blood. All that was over now. She had long since found peace. And Frederick, from her passionately loved bridegroom, from her worshipped young husband, had become second only to God on her list of duties and forbearances. There he hung, the second in importance, a bloodless thing bled white by her prayers. For years she had been able to be happy only by forgetting happiness. She wanted to stay like that. She wanted to shut out everything that would remind her of beautiful things, that might set her off again longing, desiring....\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like so much to be friends,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cWon\u2019t you come and see me, or let me come to you sometimes? Whenever you feel as if you wanted to talk. I\u2019ll give you my address\u201d\u2014she searched in her handbag\u2014\u201cand then you won\u2019t forget.\u201d And she found a card and held it out.\n\nMrs. Wilkins ignored the card.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so funny,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, just as if she had not heard her, \u201cbut I see us both\u2014you and me\u2014this April in the mediaeval castle.\u201d\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot relapsed into uneasiness. \u201cDo you?\u201d she said, making an effort to stay balanced under the visionary gaze of the shining grey eyes. \u201cDo you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you ever see things in a kind of flash before they happen?\u201d asked Mrs. Wilkins.\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\nShe tried to smile; she tried to smile the sympathetic yet wise and tolerant smile with which she was accustomed to listen to the necessarily biassed and incomplete views of the poor. She didn\u2019t succeed. The smile trembled out.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said in a low voice, almost as if she were afraid the vicar and the Savings Bank were listening, \u201cit would be most beautiful\u2014most beautiful\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if it were wrong,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, \u201cit would only be for a month.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2014\u201d began Mrs. Arbuthnot, quite clear as to the reprehensibleness of such a point of view; but Mrs. Wilkins stopped her before she could finish.\n\n\u201cAnyhow,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, stopping her, \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s wrong to go on being good for too long, till one gets miserable. And I can see you\u2019ve been good for years and years, because you look so unhappy\u201d\u2014Mrs. Arbuthnot opened her mouth to protest\u2014\u201cand I\u2014I\u2019ve done nothing but duties, things for other people, ever since I was a girl, and I don\u2019t believe anybody loves me a bit\u2014a bit\u2014the b-better\u2014and I long\u2014oh, I long\u2014for something else\u2014something else\u2014\u201d\n\nWas she going to cry? Mrs. Arbuthnot became acutely uncomfortable and sympathetic. She hoped she wasn\u2019t going to cry. Not there. Not in that unfriendly room, with strangers coming and going.\n\nBut Mrs. Wilkins, after tugging agitatedly at a handkerchief that wouldn\u2019t come out of her pocket, did succeed at last in merely apparently blowing her nose with it, and then, blinking her eyes very quickly once or twice, looked at Mrs. Arbuthnot with a quivering air of half humble, half frightened apology, and smiled.\n\n\u201cWill you believe,\u201d she whispered, trying to steady her mouth, evidently dreadfully ashamed of herself, \u201cthat I\u2019ve never spoken to any one before in my life like this? I can\u2019t think, I simply don\u2019t know, what has come over me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the advertisement,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot, nodding gravely.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, dabbing furtively at her eyes, \u201cand us both being so\u2014\u201d\u2014she blew her nose again a little\u2014\u201cmiserable.\u201d\nChapter 2\n\nOf course Mrs. Arbuthnot was not miserable\u2014how could she be, she asked herself, when God was taking care of her?\u2014but she let that pass for the moment unrepudiated, because of her conviction that here was another fellow-creature in urgent need of her help; and not just boots and blankets and better sanitary arrangements this time, but the more delicate help of comprehension, of finding the exact right words.\n\nThe exact right words, she presently discovered, after trying various ones about living for others, and prayer, and the peace to be found in placing oneself unreservedly in God\u2019s hands\u2014to meet all these words Mrs. Wilkins had other words, incoherent and yet, for the moment at least, till one had had more time, difficult to answer\u2014the exact right words were a suggestion that it would do no harm to answer the advertisement. Non-committal. Mere inquiry. And what disturbed Mrs. Arbuthnot about this suggestion was that she did not make it solely to comfort Mrs. Wilkins; she made it because of her own strange longing for the mediaeval castle.\n\nThis was very disturbing. There she was, accustomed to direct, to lead, to advise, to support\u2014except Frederick; she long since had learned to leave Frederick to God\u2014being led herself, being influenced and thrown off her feet, by just an advertisement, by just an incoherent stranger. It was indeed disturbing. She failed to understand her sudden longing for what was, after all, self-indulgence, when for years no such desire had entered her heart.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no harm in simply asking,\u201d she said in a low voice, as if the vicar and the Savings Bank and all her waiting and dependent poor were listening and condemning.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t as if it committed us to anything,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, also in a low voice, but her voice shook.\n\nThey got up simultaneously\u2014Mrs. Arbuthnot had a sensation of surprise that Mrs. Wilkins should be so tall\u2014and went to a writing-table, and Mrs. Arbuthnot wrote to Z, Box 1000, The Times, for particulars. She asked for all particulars, but the only one they really wanted was the one about the rent. They both felt that it was Mrs. Arbuthnot who ought to write the letter and do the business part. Not only was she used to organising and being practical, but she also was older, and certainly calmer; and she herself had no doubt too that she was wiser. Neither had Mrs. Wilkins any doubt of this; the very way Mrs. Arbuthnot parted her hair suggested a great calm that could only proceed from wisdom.\n\nBut if she was wiser, older and calmer, Mrs. Arbuthnot\u2019s new friend nevertheless seemed to her to be the one who impelled. Incoherent, she yet impelled. She appeared to have, apart from her need of help, an upsetting kind of character. She had a curious infectiousness. She led one on. And the way her unsteady mind leaped at conclusions\u2014wrong ones, of course; witness the one that she, Mrs. Arbuthnot, was miserable\u2014the way she leaped at conclusions was disconcerting.\n\nWhatever she was, however, and whatever her unsteadiness, Mrs. Arbuthnot found herself sharing her excitement and her longing; and when the letter had been posted in the letter-box in the hall and actually was beyond getting back again, both she and Mrs. Wilkins felt the same sense of guilt.\n\n\u201cIt only shows,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins in a whisper, as they turned away from the letter-box, \u201chow immaculately good we\u2019ve been all our lives. The very first time we do anything our husbands don\u2019t know about we feel guilty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been immaculately good,\u201d gently protested Mrs. Arbuthnot, a little uncomfortable at this fresh example of successful leaping at conclusions, for she had not said a word about her feeling of guilt.\n\n\u201cOh, but I\u2019m sure you have\u2014I see you being good\u2014and that\u2019s why you\u2019re not happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t say things like that,\u201d thought Mrs. Arbuthnot. \u201cI must try and help her not to.\u201d\n\nAloud she said gravely, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you insist that I\u2019m not happy. When you know me better I think you\u2019ll find that I am. And I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t mean really that goodness, if one could attain it, makes one unhappy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I do,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins. \u201cOur sort of goodness does. We have attained it, and we are unhappy. There are miserable sorts of goodness and happy sorts\u2014the sort we\u2019ll have at the mediaeval castle, for instance, is the happy sort.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is, supposing we go there,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot restrainingly. She felt that Mrs. Wilkins needed holding on to. \u201cAfter all, we\u2019ve only written just to ask. Anybody may do that. I think it quite likely we shall find the conditions impossible, and even if they were not, probably by to-morrow we shall not want to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see us there,\u201d was Mrs. Wilkins\u2019s answer to that.\n\nAll this was very unbalancing. Mrs. Arbuthnot, as she presently splashed through the dripping streets on her way to a meeting she was to speak at, was in an unusually disturbed condition of mind. She had, she hoped, shown herself very calm to Mrs. Wilkins, very practical and sober, concealing her own excitement. But she was really extraordinarily moved, and she felt happy, and she felt guilty, and she felt afraid, and she had all the feelings, though this she did not know, of a woman who has come away from a secret meeting with her lover. That, indeed, was what she looked like when she arrived late on her platform; she, the open-browed, looked almost furtive as her eyes fell on the staring wooden faces waiting to hear her try and persuade them to contribute to the alleviation of the urgent needs of the Hampstead poor, each one convinced that they needed contributions themselves. She looked as though she were hiding something discreditable but delightful. Certainly her customary clear expression of candour was not there, and its place was taken by a kind of suppressed and frightened pleasedness, which would have led a more worldly-minded audience to the instant conviction of recent and probably impassioned lovemaking.\n\nBeauty, beauty, beauty . . . the words kept ringing in her ears as she stood on the platform talking of sad things to the sparsely attended meeting. She had never been to Italy. Was that really what her nest-egg was to be spent on after all? Though she couldn\u2019t approve of the way Mrs. Wilkins was introducing the idea of predestination into her immediate future, just as if she had no choice, just as if to struggle, or even to reflect, were useless, it yet influenced her. Mrs. Wilkins\u2019s eyes had been the eyes of a seer. Some people were like that, Mrs. Arbuthnot knew; and if Mrs. Wilkins had actually seen her at the mediaeval castle it did seem probable that struggling would be a waste of time. Still, to spend her nest-egg on self-indulgence\u2014 The origin of this egg had been corrupt, but she had at least supposed its end was to be creditable. Was she to deflect it from its intended destination, which alone had appeared to justify her keeping it, and spend it on giving herself pleasure?\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot spoke on and on, so much practised in the kind of speech that she could have said it all in her sleep, and at the end of the meeting, her eyes dazzled by her secret visions, she hardly noticed that nobody was moved in any way whatever, least of all in the way of contributions.\n\nBut the vicar noticed. The vicar was disappointed. Usually his good friend and supporter Mrs. Arbuthnot succeeded better than this. And, what was even more unusual, she appeared, he observed, not even to mind.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine,\u201d he said to her as they parted, speaking irritably, for he was irritated both by the audience and by her, \u201cwhat these people are coming to. Nothing seems to move them.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps they need a holiday,\u201d suggested Mrs. Arbuthnot; an unsatisfactory, a queer reply, the vicar thought.\n\n\u201cIn February?\u201d he called after her sarcastically.\n\n\u201cOh no\u2014not till April,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot over her shoulder.\n\n\u201cVery odd,\u201d thought the vicar. \u201cVery odd indeed.\u201d And he went home and was not perhaps quite christian to his wife.\n\nThat night in her prayers Mrs. Arbuthnot asked for guidance. She felt she ought really to ask, straight out and roundly, that the mediaeval castle should already have been taken by some one else and the whole thing thus be settled, but her courage failed her. Suppose her prayer were to be answered? No; she couldn\u2019t ask it; she couldn\u2019t risk it. And after all\u2014she almost pointed this out to God\u2014if she spent her present nest-egg on a holiday she could quite soon accumulate another. Frederick pressed money on her; and it would only mean, while she rolled up a second egg, that for a time her contributions to the parish charities would be less. And then it could be the next nest-egg whose original corruption would be purged away by the use to which it was finally put.\n\nFor Mrs. Arbuthnot, who had no money of her own, was obliged to live on the proceeds of Frederick\u2019s activities, and her very nest-egg was the fruit, posthumously ripened, of ancient sin. The way Frederick made his living was one of the standing distresses of her life. He wrote immensely popular memoirs, regularly, every year, of the mistresses of kings. There were in history numerous kings who had had mistresses, and there were still more numerous mistresses who had had kings; so that he had been able to publish a book of memoirs during each year of his married life, and even so there were great further piles of these ladies waiting to be dealt with. Mrs. Arbuthnot was helpless. Whether she liked it or not, she was obliged to live on the proceeds. He gave her a dreadful sofa once, after the success of his Du Barri memoir, with swollen cushions and soft, receptive lap, and it seemed to her a miserable thing that there, in her very home, should flaunt this re-incarnation of a dead old French sinner.\n\nSimply good, convinced that morality is the basis of happiness, the fact that she and Frederick should draw their sustenance from guilt, however much purged by the passage of centuries, was one of the secret reasons of her sadness. The more the memoired lady had forgotten herself, the more his book about her was read and the more free-handed he was to his wife; and all that he gave her was spent, after adding slightly to her nest-egg\u2014for she did hope and believe that some day people would cease to want to read of wickedness, and then Frederick would need supporting\u2014on helping the poor. The parish flourished because, to take a handful at random, of the ill-behaviour of the ladies Du Barri, Montespan, Pompadour, Ninon de l\u2019Enclos, and even of learned Maintenon. The poor were the filter through which the money was passed, to come out, Mrs. Arbuthnot hoped, purified. She could do no more. She had tried in days gone by to think the situation out, to discover the exact right course for her to take, but had found it, as she had found Frederick, too difficult, and had left it, as she had left Frederick, to God. Nothing of this money was spent on her house or dress; those remained, except for the great soft sofa, austere. It was the poor who profited. Their very boots were stout with sins. But how difficult it had been. Mrs. Arbuthnot, groping for guidance, prayed about it to exhaustion. Ought she perhaps to refuse to touch the money, to avoid it as she would have avoided the sins which were its source? But then what about the parish\u2019s boots? She asked the vicar what he thought, and, through much delicate language, evasive and cautious, it did finally appear that he was for the boots.\n\nAt least she had persuaded Frederick, when first he began his terrible successful career\u2014he only began it after their marriage; when she married him he had been a blameless official attached to the library of the British Museum\u2014to publish the memoirs under another name, so that she was not publicly branded. Hampstead read the books with glee, and had no idea that their writer lived in its midst. Frederick was almost unknown, even by sight, in Hampstead. He never went to any of its gatherings. Whatever it was he did in the way of recreation was done in London, but he never spoke of what he did or whom he saw; he might have been perfectly friendless for any mention he ever made of friends to his wife. Only the vicar knew where the money for the parish came from, and he regarded it, he told Mrs. Arbuthnot, as a matter of honour not to mention it.\n\nAnd at least her little house was not haunted by the loose-lived ladies, for Frederick did his work away from home. He had two rooms near the British Museum, which was the scene of his exhumations, and there he went every morning, and he came back long after his wife was asleep. Sometimes he did not come back at all. Sometimes she did not see him for several days together. Then he would suddenly appear at breakfast, having let himself in with his latchkey the night before, very jovial and good-natured and free-handed and glad if she would allow him to give her something\u2014a well-fed man, contented with the world; a jolly, full-blooded, satisfied man. And she was always gentle, and anxious that his coffee should be as he liked it.\n\nHe seemed very happy. Life, she often thought, however much one tabulated was yet a mystery. There were always some people it was impossible to place. Frederick was one of them. He didn\u2019t seem to bear the remotest resemblance to the original Frederick. He didn\u2019t seem to have the least need of any of the things he used to say were so important and beautiful\u2014love, home, complete communion of thoughts, complete immersion in each other\u2019s interests. After those early painful attempts to hold him up to the point from which they had hand in hand so splendidly started, attempts in which she herself had got terribly hurt and the Frederick she supposed she had married was mangled out of recognition, she hung him up finally by her bedside as the chief subject of her prayers, and left him, except for those, entirely to God. She had loved Frederick too deeply to be able now to do anything but pray for him. He had no idea that he never went out of the house without her blessing going with him too, hovering, like a little echo of finished love, round that once dear head. She didn\u2019t dare think of him as he used to be, as he had seemed to her to be in those marvellous first days of their love-making, of their marriage. Her child had died; she had nothing, nobody of her own to lavish herself on. The poor became her children, and God the object of her love. What could be happier than such a life, she sometimes asked herself; but her face, and particularly her eyes, continued sad.\n\n\u201cPerhaps when we\u2019re old . . . perhaps when we are both quite old . . .\u201d she would think wistfully.\nChapter 3\n\nThe owner of the mediaeval castle was an Englishman, a Mr. Briggs, who was in London at the moment and wrote that it had beds enough for eight people, exclusive of servants, three sitting-rooms, battlements, dungeons, and electric light. The rent was \xa360 for the month, the servants\u2019 wages were extra, and he wanted references\u2014he wanted assurances that the second half of his rent would be paid, the first half being paid in advance, and he wanted assurances of respectability from a solicitor, or a doctor, or a clergyman. He was very polite in his letter, explaining that his desire for references was what was usual and should be regarded as a mere formality.\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins had not thought of references, and they had not dreamed a rent could be so high. In their minds had floated sums like three guineas a week; or less, seeing that the place was small and old.\n\nSixty pounds for a single month.\n\nIt staggered them.\n\nBefore Mrs. Arbuthnot\u2019s eyes rose up boots: endless vistas, all the stout boots that sixty pounds would buy; and besides the rent there would be the servants\u2019 wagesc, and the food, and the railway journeys out and home. While as for references, these did indeed seem a stumbling-block; it did seem impossible to give any without making their plan more public than they had intended.\n\nThey had both\u2014even Mrs. Arbuthnot, lured for once away from perfect candour by the realisation of the great saving of trouble and criticism an imperfect explanation would produce\u2014they had both thought it would be a good plan to give out, each to her own circle, their circles being luckily distinct, that each was going to stay with a friend who had a house in Italy. It would be true as far as it went\u2014Mrs. Wilkins asserted that it would be quite true, but Mrs. Arbuthnot thought it wouldn\u2019t be quite\u2014and it was the only way, Mrs. Wilkins said, to keep Mellersh even approximately quiet. To spend any of her money just on the mere getting to Italy would cause him indignation; what he would say if he knew she was renting part of a mediaeval castle on her own account Mrs. Wilkins preferred not to think. It would take him days to say it all; and this although it was her very own money, and not a penny of it had ever been his.\n\n\u201cBut I expect,\u201d she said, \u201cyour husband is just the same. I expect all husbands are alike in the long run.\u201d\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot said nothing, because her reason for not wanting Frederick to know was the exactly opposite one\u2014Frederick would be only too pleased for her to go, he would not mind it in the very least; indeed, he would hail such a manifestation of self-indulgence and worldliness with an amusement that would hurt, and urge her to have a good time and not to hurry home with a crushing detachment. Far better, she thought, to be missed by Mellersh than to be sped by Frederick. To be missed, to be needed, from whatever motive, was, she thought, better than the complete loneliness of not being missed or needed at all.\n\nShe therefore said nothing, and allowed Mrs. Wilkins to leap at her conclusions unchecked. But they did, both of them, for a whole day feel that the only thing to be done was to renounce the mediaeval castle; and it was in arriving at this bitter decision that they really realised how acute had been their longing for it.\n\nThen Mrs. Arbuthnot, whose mind was trained in the finding of ways out of difficulties, found a way out of the reference difficulty; and simultaneously Mrs. Wilkins had a vision revealing to her how to reduce the rent.\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot\u2019s plan was simple, and completely successful. She took the whole of the rent in person to the owner, drawing it out of her Savings Bank\u2014again she looked furtive and apologetic, as if the clerk must know the money was wanted for purposes of self-indulgence\u2014and, going up with the six ten pound notes in her hand-bag to the address near the Brompton Oratory where the owner lived, presented them to him, waiving her right to pay only half. And when he saw her, and her parted hair and soft dark eyes and sober apparel, and heard her grave voice, he told her not to bother about writing round for those references.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he said, scribbling a receipt for the rent. \u201cDo sit down, won\u2019t you? Nasty day, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019ll find the old castle has lots of sunshine, whatever else it hasn\u2019t got. Husband going?\u201d\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot, unused to anything but candour, looked troubled at this question and began to murmur inarticulately, and the owner at once concluded that she was a widow\u2014a war one, of course, for other widows were old\u2014and that he had been a fool not to guess it.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, turning red right up to his fair hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014h\u2019m, h\u2019m, h\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\nHe ran his eye over the receipt he had written. \u201cYes, I think that\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, getting up and giving it to her. \u201cNow,\u201d he added, taking the six notes she held out and smiling, for Mrs. Arbuthnot was agreeable to look at, \u201cI\u2019m richer, and you\u2019re happier. I\u2019ve got money, and you\u2019ve got San Salvatore. I wonder which is best.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you know,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot with her sweet smile.\n\nHe laughed and opened the door for her. It was a pity the interview was over. He would have liked to ask her to lunch with him. She made him think of his mother, of his nurse, of all things kind and comforting, besides having the attraction of not being his mother or his nurse.\n\n\u201cI hope you\u2019ll like the old place,\u201d he said, holding her hand a minute at the door. The very feel of her hand, even through its glove, was reassuring; it was the sort of hand, he thought, that children would like to hold in the dark. \u201cIn April, you know, it\u2019s simply a mass of flowers. And then there\u2019s the sea. You must wear white. You\u2019ll fit in very well. There are several portraits of you there.\u201d\n\n\u201cPortraits?\u201d\n\n\u201cMadonnas, you know. There\u2019s one on the stairs really exactly like you.\u201d\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot smiled and said good-bye and thanked him. Without the least trouble and at once she had got him placed in his proper category: he was an artist and of an effervescent temperament.\n\nShe shook hands and left, and he wished she hadn\u2019t. After she was gone he supposed that he ought to have asked for those references, if only because she would think him so unbusiness-like not to, but he could as soon have insisted on references from a saint in a nimbus as from that grave, sweet lady.\n\nRose Arbuthnot.\n\nHer letter, making the appointment, lay on the table.\n\nPretty name.\n\nThat difficulty, then, was overcome. But there still remained the other one, the really annihilating effect of the expense on the nest-eggs, and especially on Mrs. Wilkins\u2019s, which was in size, compared with Mrs. Arbuthnot\u2019s, as the egg of the plover to that of the duck; and this in its turn was overcome by the vision vouchsafed to Mrs. Wilkins, revealing to her the steps to be taken for its overcoming. Having got San Salvatore\u2014the beautiful, the religious name, fascinated them\u2014they in their turn would advertise in the Agony Column of The Times, and would inquire after two more ladies, of similar desires to their own, to join them and share the expenses.\n\nAt once the strain of the nest-eggs would be reduced from half to a quarter. Mrs. Wilkins was prepared to fling her entire egg into the adventure, but she realised that if it were to cost even sixpence over her ninety pounds her position would be terrible. Imagine going to Mellersh and saying, \u201cI owe.\u201d It would be awful enough if some day circumstances forced her to say, \u201cI have no nest-egg,\u201d but at least she would be supported in such a case by the knowledge that the egg had been her own. She therefore, though prepared to fling her last penny into the adventure, was not prepared to fling into it a single farthing that was not demonstrably her own; and she felt that if her share of the rent was reduced to fifteen pounds only, she would have a safe margin for the other expenses. Also they might economise very much on food\u2014gather olives off their own trees and eat them, for instance, and perhaps catch fish.\n\nOf course, as they pointed out to each other, they could reduce the rent to an almost negligible sum by increasing the number of sharers; they could have six more ladies instead of two if they wanted to, seeing that there were eight beds. But supposing the eight beds were distributed in couples in four rooms, it would not be altogether what they wanted, to find themselves shut up at night with a stranger. Besides, they thought that perhaps having so many would not be quite so peaceful. After all, they were going to San Salvatore for peace and rest and joy, and six more ladies, especially if they got into one\u2019s bedroom, might a little interfere with that.\n\nHowever, there seemed to be only two ladies in England at that moment who had any wish to join them, for they had only two answers to their advertisement.\n\n\u201cWell, we only want two,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, quickly recovering, for she had imagined a great rush.\n\n\u201cI think a choice would have been a good thing,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\u201cYou mean because then we needn\u2019t have had Lady Caroline Dester.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d gently protested Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\u201cWe needn\u2019t have her,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins. \u201cJust one more person would help us a great deal with the rent. We\u2019re not obliged to have two.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why should we not have her? She seems really quite what we want.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014she does from her letter,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins doubtfully.\n\nShe felt she would be terribly shy of Lady Caroline. Incredible as it may seem, seeing how they get into everything, Mrs. Wilkins had never come across any members of the aristocracy.\n\nThey interviewed Lady Caroline, and they interviewed the other applicant, a Mrs. Fisher.\n\nLady Caroline came to the club in Shaftesbury Avenue, and appeared to be wholly taken up by one great longing, a longing to get away from everybody she had ever known. When she saw the club, and Mrs. Arbuthnot, and Mrs. Wilkins, she was sure that here was exactly what she wanted. She would be in Italy\u2014a place she adored; she would not be in hotels\u2014places she loathed; she would not be staying with friends\u2014persons she disliked; and she would be in the company of strangers who would never mention a single person she knew, for the simple reason that they had not, could not have, and would not come across them. She asked a few questions about the fourth woman, and was satisfied with the answers. Mrs. Fisher, of Prince of Wales Terrace. A widow. She too would be unacquainted with any of her friends. Lady Caroline did not even know where Prince of Wales Terrace was.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in London,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\u201cIs it?\u201d said Lady Caroline.\n\nIt all seemed most restful.\n\nMrs. Fisher was unable to come to the club because, she explained by letter, she could not walk without a stick; therefore Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins went to her.\n\n\u201cBut if she can\u2019t come to the club how can she go to Italy?\u201d wondered Mrs. Wilkins, aloud.\n\n\u201cWe shall hear that from her own lips,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\nFrom Mrs. Fisher\u2019s lips they merely heard, in reply to delicate questioning, that sitting in trains was not walking about; and they knew that already. Except for the stick, however, she appeared to be a most desirable fourth\u2014quiet, educated, elderly. She was much older than they or Lady Caroline\u2014Lady Caroline had informed them she was twenty-eight\u2014but not so old as to have ceased to be active-minded. She was very respectable indeed, and still wore a complete suit of black though her husband had died, she told them, eleven years before. Her house was full of signed photographs of illustrious Victorian dead, all of whom she said she had known when she was little. Her father had been an eminent critic, and in his house she had seen practically everybody who was anybody in letters and art. Carlyle had scowled at her; Matthew Arnold had held her on his knee; Tennyson had sonorously rallied her on the length of her pig-tail. She animatedly showed them the photographs, hung everywhere on her walls, pointing out the signatures with her stick, and she neither gave any information about her own husband nor asked for any about the husbands of her visitors; which was the greatest comfort. Indeed, she seemed to think that they also were widows, for on inquiring who the fourth lady was to be, and being told it was a Lady Caroline Dester, she said, \u201cIs she a widow too?\u201d And on their explaining that she was not, because she had not yet been married, observed with abstracted amiability, \u201cAll in good time.\u201d\n\nBut Mrs. Fisher\u2019s very abstractedness\u2014and she seemed to be absorbed chiefly in the interesting people she used to know and in their memorial photographs, and quite a good part of the interview was taken up by reminiscent anecdote of Carlyle, Meredith, Matthew Arnold, Tennyson, and a host of others\u2014her very abstractedness was a recommendation. She only asked, she said, to be allowed to sit quiet in the sun and remember. That was all Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins asked of their sharers. It was their idea of a perfect sharer that she should sit quiet in the sun and remember, rousing herself on Saturday evenings sufficiently to pay her share. Mrs. Fisher was very fond, too, she said, of flowers, and once when she was spending a week-end with her father at Box Hill\u2014\n\n\u201cWho lived at Box Hill?\u201d interrupted Mrs. Wilkins, who hung on Mrs. Fisher\u2019s reminiscences, intensely excited by meeting somebody who had actually been familiar with all the really and truly and undoubtedly great\u2014actually seen them, heard them talking, touched them.\n\nMrs. Fisher looked at her over the top of her glasses in some surprise. Mrs. Wilkins, in her eagerness to tear the heart out quickly of Mrs. Fisher\u2019s reminiscences, afraid that at any moment Mrs. Arbuthnot would take her away and she wouldn\u2019t have heard half, had already interrupted several times with questions which appeared ignorant to Mrs. Fisher.\n\n\u201cMeredith of course,\u201d said Mrs. Fisher rather shortly. \u201cI remember a particular week-end\u201d\u2014she continued. \u201cMy father often took me, but I always remember this week-end particularly\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you know Keats?\u201d eagerly interrupted Mrs. Wilkins.\n\nMrs. Fisher, after a pause, said with sub-acid reserve that she had been unacquainted with both Keats and Shakespeare.\n\n\u201cOh of course\u2014how ridiculous of me!\u201d cried Mrs. Wilkins, flushing scarlet. \u201cIt\u2019s because\u201d\u2014she floundered\u2014\u201cit\u2019s because the immortals somehow still seem alive, don\u2019t they\u2014as if they were here, going to walk into the room in another minute\u2014and one forgets they are dead. In fact one knows perfectly well that they\u2019re not dead\u2014not nearly so dead as you and I even now,\u201d she assured Mrs. Fisher, who observed her over the top of her glasses.\n\n\u201cI thought I saw Keats the other day,\u201d Mrs. Wilkins incoherently proceeded, driven on by Mrs. Fisher\u2019s look over the top of her glasses. \u201cIn Hampstead\u2014crossing the road in front of that house\u2014you know\u2014the house where he lived\u2014\u201d\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot said they must be going.\n\nMrs. Fisher did nothing to prevent them.\n\n\u201cI really thought I saw him,\u201d protested Mrs. Wilkins, appealing for belief first to one and then to the other while waves of colour passed over her face, and totally unable to stop because of Mrs. Fisher\u2019s glasses and the steady eyes looking at her over their tops. \u201cI believe I did see him\u2014he was dressed in a\u2014\u201d\n\nEven Mrs. Arbuthnot looked at her now, and in her gentlest voice said they would be late for lunch.\n\nIt was at this point that Mrs. Fisher asked for references. She had no wish to find herself shut up for four weeks with somebody who saw things. It is true that there were three sitting-rooms, besides the garden and the battlements at San Salvatore, so that there would be opportunities of withdrawal from Mrs. Wilkins; but it would be disagreeable to Mrs. Fisher, for instance, if Mrs. Wilkins were suddenly to assert that she saw Mr. Fisher. Mr. Fisher was dead; let him remain so. She had no wish to be told he was walking about the garden. The only reference she really wanted, for she was much too old and firmly seated in her place in the world for questionable associates to matter to her, was one with regard to Mrs. Wilkins\u2019s health. Was her health quite normal? Was she an ordinary, everyday, sensible woman? Mrs. Fisher felt that if she were given even one address she would be able to find out what she needed. So she asked for references, and her visitors appeared to be so much taken aback\u2014Mrs. Wilkins, indeed, was instantly sobered\u2014that she added, \u201cIt is usual.\u201d\n\nMrs. Wilkins found her speech first. \u201cBut,\u201d she said, \u201caren\u2019t we the ones who ought to ask for some from you?\u201d\n\nAnd this seemed to Mrs. Arbuthnot too the right attitude. Surely it was they who were taking Mrs. Fisher into their party, and not Mrs. Fisher who was taking them into it?\n\nFor answer Mrs. Fisher, leaning on her stick, went to the writing-table and in a firm hand wrote down three names and offered them to Mrs. Wilkins, and the names were so respectable, more, they were so momentous, they were so nearly august, that just to read them was enough. The President of the Royal Academy, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Governor of the Bank of England\u2014who would dare disturb such personages in their meditations with inquiries as to whether a female friend of theirs was all she should be?\n\n\u201cThey have known me since I was little,\u201d said Mrs. Fisher\u2014everybody seemed to have known Mrs. Fisher since or when she was little.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think references are nice things at all between\u2014between ordinary decent women,\u201d burst out Mrs. Wilkins, made courageous by being, as she felt, at bay; for she very well knew that the only reference she could give without getting into trouble was Shoolbred, and she had little confidence in that, as it would be entirely based on Mellersh\u2019s fish. \u201cWe\u2019re not business people. We needn\u2019t distrust each other\u2014\u201d\n\nAnd Mrs. Arbuthnot said, with a dignity that yet was sweet, \u201cI\u2019m afraid references do bring an atmosphere into our holiday plan that isn\u2019t quite what we want, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll take yours up or give you any ourselves. So that I suppose you won\u2019t wish to join us.\u201d\n\nAnd she held out her hand in good-bye.\n\nThen Mrs. Fisher, her gaze diverted to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who inspired trust and liking even in Tube officials, felt that she would be idiotic to lose the opportunity of being in Italy in the particular conditions offered, and that she and this calm-browed woman between them would certainly be able to curb the other one when she had her attacks. So she said, taking Mrs. Arbuthnot\u2019s offered hand, \u201cVery well. I waive references.\u201d\n\nShe waived references.\n\nThe two as they walked to the station in Kensington High Street could not help thinking that this way of putting it was lofty. Even Mrs. Arbuthnot, spendthrift of excuses for lapses, thought Mrs. Fisher might have used other words; and Mrs. Wilkins, by the time she got to the station, and the walk and the struggle on the crowded pavement with other people\u2019s umbrellas had warmed her blood, actually suggested waiving Mrs. Fisher.\n\n\u201cIf there is any waiving to be done, do let us be the ones who waive,\u201d she said eagerly.\n\nBut Mrs. Arbuthnot, as usual, held on to Mrs. Wilkins; and presently, having cooled down in the train, Mrs. Wilkins announced that at San Salvatore Mrs. Fisher would find her level. \u201cI see her finding her level there,\u201d she said, her eyes very bright.\n\nWhereupon Mrs. Arbuthnot, sitting with her quiet hands folded, turned over in her mind how best she could help Mrs. Wilkins not to see quite so much; or at least, if she must see, to see in silence.\nChapter 4\n\nIt had been arranged that Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins, travelling together, should arrive at San Salvatore on the evening of March 31st\u2014the owner, who told them how to get there, appreciated their disinclination to begin their time in it on April 1st\u2014and Lady Caroline and Mrs. Fisher, as yet unacquainted and therefore under no obligations to bore each other on the journey, for only towards the end would they find out by a process of sifting who they were, were to arrive on the morning of April 2nd. In this way everything would be got nicely ready for the two who seemed, in spite of the equality of the sharing, yet to have something about them of guests.\n\nThere were disagreeable incidents towards the end of March, when Mrs. Wilkins, her heart in her mouth and her face a mixture of guilt, terror and determination, told her husband that she had been invited to Italy, and he declined to believe it. Of course he declined to believe it. Nobody had ever invited his wife to Italy before. There was no precedent. He required proofs. The only proof was Mrs. Arbuthnot, and Mrs. Wilkins had produced her; but after what entreaties, what passionate persuading! Mrs. Arbuthnot had not imagined she would have to face Mr. Wilkins and say things to him that were short of the truth, and it brought home to her what she had for some time suspected, that she was slipping more and more away from God.\n\nIndeed, the whole of March was filled with unpleasant, anxious moments. It was an uneasy month. Mrs. Arbuthnot\u2019s conscience, made super-sensitive by years of pampering, could not reconcile what she was doing with its own high standard of what was right. It gave her little peace. It nudged her at her prayers. It punctuated her entreaties for divine guidance with disconcerting questions, such as, \u201cAre you not a hypocrite? Do you really mean that? Would you not, frankly, be disappointed if that prayer were granted?\u201d\n\nThe prolonged wet, raw weather was on the side too of her conscience, producing far more sickness than usual among the poor. They had bronchitis; they had fevers; there was no end to the distress. And here she was going off, spending precious money on going off, simply and solely to be happy. One woman. One woman being happy, and these piteous multitudes . . .\n\nShe was unable to look the vicar in the face. He did not know, nobody knew, what she was going to do, and from the very beginning she was unable to look anybody in the face. She excused herself from making speeches appealing for money. How could she stand up and ask people for money when she herself was spending so much on her own selfish pleasure? Nor did it help her or quiet her that, having actually told Frederick, in her desire to make up for what she was squandering, that she would be grateful if he would let her have some money, he instantly gave her a cheque for \xa3100. He asked no questions. She was scarlet. He looked at her a moment and then looked away. It was a relief to Frederick that she should take some money. She gave it all immediately to the organisation she worked with, and found herself more tangled in doubts than ever.\n\nMrs. Wilkins, on the contrary, had no doubts. She was quite certain that it was a most proper thing to have a holiday, and altogether right and beautiful to spend one\u2019s own hard-collected savings on being happy.\n\n\u201cThink how much nicer we shall be when we come back,\u201d she said to Mrs. Arbuthnot, encouraging that pale lady.\n\nNo, Mrs. Wilkins had no doubts, but she had fears; and March was for her too an anxious month, with the unconscious Mr. Wilkins coming back daily to his dinner and eating his fish in the silence of imagined security.\n\nAlso things happen so awkwardly. It really is astonishing, how awkwardly they happen. Mrs. Wilkins, who was very careful all this month to give Mellersh only the food he liked, buying it and hovering over its cooking with a zeal more than common, succeeded so well that Mellersh was pleased; definitely pleased; so much pleased that he began to think that he might, after all, have married the right wife instead of, as he had frequently suspected, the wrong one. The result was that on the third Sunday in the month\u2014Mrs. Wilkins had made up her trembling mind that on the fourth Sunday, there being five in that March and it being on the fifth of them that she and Mrs. Arbuthnot were to start, she would tell Mellersh of her invitation\u2014on the third Sunday, then, after a very well-cooked lunch in which the Yorkshire pudding had melted in his mouth and the apricot tart had been so perfect that he ate it all, Mellersh, smoking his cigar by the brightly burning fire the while hail gusts banged on the window, said: \u201cI am thinking of taking you to Italy for Easter.\u201d And paused for her astounded and grateful ecstasy.\n\nNone came. The silence in the room, except for the hail hitting the windows and the gay roar of the fire, was complete. Mrs. Wilkins could not speak. She was dumbfounded. The next Sunday was the day she had meant to break her news to him, and she had not yet even prepared the form of words in which she would break it.\n\nMr. Wilkins, who had not been abroad since before the war, and was noticing with increasing disgust, as week followed week of wind and rain, the peculiar persistent vileness of the weather, had slowly conceived a desire to get away from England for Easter. He was doing very well in his business. He could afford a trip. Switzerland was useless in April. There was a familiar sound about Easter in Italy. To Italy he would go; and as it would cause comment if he did not take his wife, take her he must\u2014besides, she would be useful; a second person was always useful in a country whose language one did not speak for holding things, for waiting with the luggage.\n\nHe had expected an explosion of gratitude and excitement. The absence of it was incredible. She could not, he concluded, have heard. Probably she was absorbed in some foolish day-dream. It was regrettable how childish she remained.\n\nHe turned his head\u2014their chairs were in front of the fire\u2014and looked at her. She was staring straight into the fire, and it was no doubt the fire that made her face so red.\n\n\u201cI am thinking,\u201d he repeated, raising his clear, cultivated voice and speaking with acerbity, for inattention at such a moment was deplorable, \u201cof taking you to Italy for Easter. Did you not hear me?\u201d\n\nYes, she had heard him, and she had been wondering at the extraordinary coincidence\u2014really most extraordinary\u2014she was just going to tell him how\u2014how she had been invited\u2014a friend had invited her\u2014Easter, too\u2014Easter was in April, wasn\u2019t it?\u2014her friend had a\u2014had a house there.\n\nIn fact Mrs. Wilkins, driven by terror, guilt and surprise, had been more incoherent if possible than usual.\n\nIt was a dreadful afternoon. Mellersh, profoundly indignant, besides having his intended treat coming back on him like a blessing to roost, cross-examined her with the utmost severity. He demanded that she refuse the invitation. He demanded that, since she had so outrageously accepted it without consulting him, she should write and cancel her acceptance. Finding himself up against an unsuspected, shocking rock of obstinacy in her, he then declined to believe she had been invited to Italy at all. He declined to believe in this Mrs. Arbuthnot, of whom till that moment he had never heard; and it was only when the gentle creature was brought round\u2014with such difficulty, with such a desire on her part to throw the whole thing up rather than tell Mr. Wilkins less than the truth\u2014and herself endorsed his wife\u2019s statements that he was able to give them credence. He could not but believe Mrs. Arbuthnot. She produced the precise effect on him that she did on Tube officials. She hardly needed to say anything. But that made no difference to her conscience, which knew and would not let her forget that she had given him an incomplete impression. \u201cDo you,\u201d asked her conscience, \u201csee any real difference between an incomplete impression and a completely stated lie? God sees none.\u201d\n\nThe remainder of March was a confused bad dream. Both Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins were shattered; try as they would not to, both felt extraordinarily guilty; and when on the morning of the 30th they did finally get off there was no exhilaration about the departure, no holiday feeling at all.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been too good\u2014much too good,\u201d Mrs. Wilkins kept on murmuring as they walked up and down the platform at Victoria, having arrived there an hour before they need have, \u201cand that\u2019s why we feel as though we\u2019re doing wrong. We\u2019re brow-beaten\u2014we\u2019re not any longer real human beings. Real human beings aren\u2019t ever as good as we\u2019ve been. Oh\u201d\u2014she clenched her thin hands\u2014\u201cto think that we ought to be so happy now, here on the very station, actually starting, and we\u2019re not, and it\u2019s being spoilt for us just simply because we\u2019ve spoilt them! What have we done\u2014what have we done, I should like to know,\u201d she inquired of Mrs. Arbuthnot indignantly, \u201cexcept for once want to go away by ourselves and have a little rest from them?\u201d\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot, patiently pacing, did not ask who she meant by them, because she knew. Mrs. Wilkins meant their husbands, persisting in her assumption that Frederick was as indignant as Mellersh over the departure of his wife, whereas Frederick did not even know his wife had gone.\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot, always silent about him, had said nothing of this to Mrs. Wilkins. Frederick went too deep into her heart for her to talk about him. He was having an extra bout of work finishing another of those dreadful books, and had been away practically continually the last few weeks, and was away when she left. Why should she tell him beforehand? Sure as she so miserably was that he would have no objection to anything she did, she merely wrote him a note and put it on the hall-table ready for him if and when he should come home. She said she was going for a month\u2019s holiday as she needed a rest and she had not had one for so long, and that Gladys, the efficient parlourmaid, had orders to see to his comforts. She did not say where she was going; there was no reason why she should; he would not be interested, he would not care.\n\nThe day was wretched, blustering and wet; the crossing was atrocious, and they were very sick. But after having been very sick, just to arrive at Calais and not be sick was happiness, and it was there that the real splendour of what they were doing first began to warm their benumbed spirits. It got hold of Mrs. Wilkins first, and spread from her like a rose-coloured flame over her pale companion. Mellersh at Calais, where they restored themselves with soles because of Mrs. Wilkins\u2019s desire to eat a sole Mellersh wasn\u2019t having\u2014Mellersh at Calais had already begun to dwindle and seem less important. None of the French porters knew him; not a single official at Calais cared a fig for Mellersh. In Paris there was no time to think of him because their train was late and they only just caught the Turin train at the Gare de Lyons; and by the afternoon of the next day when they got into Italy, England, Frederick, Mellersh, the vicar, the poor, Hampstead, the club, Shoolbred, everybody and everything, the whole inflamed sore dreariness, had faded to the dimness of a dream.\nChapter 5\n\nIt was cloudy in Italy, which surprised them. They had expected brilliant sunshine. But never mind: it was Italy, and the very clouds looked fat. Neither of them had ever been there before. Both gazed out of the windows with rapt faces. The hours flew as long as it was daylight, and after that there was the excitement of getting nearer, getting quite near, getting there. At Genoa it had begun to rain\u2014Genoa! Imagine actually being at Genoa, seeing its name written up in the station just like any other name\u2014at Nervi it was pouring, and when at last towards midnight, for again the train was late, they got to Mezzago, the rain was coming down in what seemed solid sheets. But it was Italy. Nothing it did could be bad. The very rain was different\u2014straight rain, falling properly on to one\u2019s umbrella; not that violently blowing English stuff that got in everywhere. And it did leave off; and when it did, behold the earth would be strewn with roses.\n\nMr. Briggs, San Salvatore\u2019s owner, had said, \u201cYou get out at Mezzago, and then you drive.\u201d But he had forgotten what he amply knew, that trains in Italy are sometimes late, and he had imagined his tenants arriving at Mezzago at eight o\u2019clock and finding a string of flys to choose from.\n\nThe train was four hours late, and when Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins scrambled down the ladder-like high steps of their carriage into the black downpour, their skirts sweeping off great pools of sooty wet because their hands were full of suit-cases, if it had not been for the vigilance of Domenico, the gardener at San Salvatore, they would have found nothing for them to drive in. All ordinary flys had long since gone home. Domenico, foreseeing this, had sent his aunt\u2019s fly, driven by her son his cousin; and his aunt and her fly lived in Castagneto, the village crouching at the feet of San Salvatore, and therefore, however late the train was, the fly would not dare come home without containing that which it had been sent to fetch.\n\nDomenico\u2019s cousin\u2019s name was Beppo, and he presently emerged out of the dark where Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins stood, uncertain what to do next after the train had gone on, for they could see no porter and they thought from the feel of it that they were standing not so much on a platform as in the middle of the permanent way.\n\nBeppo, who had been searching for them, emerged from the dark with a kind of pounce and talked Italian to them vociferously. Beppo was a most respectable young man, but he did not look as if he were, especially not in the dark, and he had a dripping hat slouched over one eye. They did not like the way he seized their suit-cases. He could not be, they thought, a porter. However, they presently from out of his streaming talk discerned the words San Salvatore, and after that they kept on saying them to him, for it was the only Italian they knew, as they hurried after him, unwilling to lose sight of their suit-cases, stumbling across rails and through puddles out to where in the road a small, high fly stood.\n\nIts hood was up, and its horse was in an attitude of thought. They climbed in, and the minute they were in\u2014Mrs. Wilkins, indeed, could hardly be called in\u2014the horse awoke with a start from its reverie and immediately began going home rapidly; without Beppo; without the suit-cases.\n\nBeppo darted after him, making the night ring with his shouts, and caught the hanging reins just in time. He explained proudly, and as it seemed to him with perfect clearness, that the horse always did that, being a fine animal full of corn and blood, and cared for by him, Beppo, as if he were his own son, and the ladies must not be alarmed\u2014he had noticed they were clutching each other; but clear, and loud, and profuse of words though he was, they only looked at him blankly.\n\nHe went on talking, however, while he piled the suit-cases up round them, sure that sooner or later they must understand him, especially as he was careful to talk very loud and illustrate everything he said with the simplest elucidatory gestures, but they both continued only to look at him. They both, he noticed sympathetically, had white faces, fatigued faces, and they both had big eyes, fatigued eyes. They were beautiful ladies, he thought, and their eyes, looking at him over the tops of the suit-cases watching his every movement\u2014there were no trunks, only numbers of suit-cases\u2014were like the eyes of the Mother of God. The only thing the ladies said, and they repeated it at regular intervals, even after they had started, gently prodding him as he sat on his box to call his attention to it, was, \u201cSan Salvatore?\u201d\n\nAnd each time he answered vociferously, encouragingly, \u201cS\xec, s\xec\u2014San Salvatore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know of course if he\u2019s taking us there,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot at last in a low voice, after they had been driving as it seemed to them a long while, and had got off the paving-stones of the sleep-shrouded town and were out on a winding road with what they could just see was a low wall on their left beyond which was a great black emptiness and the sound of the sea. On their right was something close and steep and high and black\u2014rocks, they whispered to each other; huge rocks.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014we don\u2019t know,\u201d agreed Mrs. Wilkins, a slight coldness passing down her spine.\n\nThey felt very uncomfortable. It was so late. It was so dark. The road was so lonely. Suppose a wheel came off. Suppose they met Fascisti, or the opposite of Fascisti. How sorry they were now that they had not slept at Genoa and come on the next morning in daylight.\n\n\u201cBut that would have been the first of April,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, in a low voice.\n\n\u201cIt is that now,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot beneath her breath.\n\n\u201cSo it is,\u201d murmured Mrs. Wilkins.\n\nThey were silent.\n\nBeppo turned round on his box\u2014a disquieting habit already noticed, for surely his horse ought to be carefully watched\u2014and again addressed them with what he was convinced was lucidity\u2014no patois, and the clearest explanatory movements.\n\nHow much they wished their mothers had made them learn Italian when they were little. If only now they could have said, \u201cPlease sit round the right way and look after the horse.\u201d They did not even know what horse was in Italian. It was contemptible to be so ignorant.\n\nIn their anxiety, for the road twisted round great jutting rocks, and on their left was only the low wall to keep them out of the sea should anything happen, they too began to gesticulate, waving their hands at Beppo, pointing ahead. They wanted him to turn round again and face his horse, that was all. He thought they wanted him to drive faster; and there followed a terrifying ten minutes during which, as he supposed, he was gratifying them. He was proud of his horse, and it could go very fast. He rose in his seat, the whip cracked, the horse rushed forward, the rocks leaped towards them, the little fly swayed, the suit-cases heaved, Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins clung. In this way they continued, swaying, heaving, clattering, clinging, till at a point near Castagneto there was a rise in the road, and on reaching the foot of the rise the horse, who knew every inch of the way, stopped suddenly, throwing everything in the fly into a heap, and then proceeded up at the slowest of walks.\n\nBeppo twisted himself round to receive their admiration, laughing with pride in his horse.\n\nThere was no answering laugh from the beautiful ladies. Their eyes, fixed on him, seemed bigger than ever, and their faces against the black of the night showed milky.\n\nBut here at least, once they were up the slope, were houses. The rocks left off, and there were houses; the low wall left off, and there were houses; the sea shrunk away, and the sound of it ceased, and the loneliness of the road was finished. No lights anywhere, of course, nobody to see them pass; and yet Beppo, when the houses began, after looking over his shoulder and shouting \u201cCastagneto\u201d at the ladies, once more stood up and cracked his whip and once more made his horse dash forward.\n\n\u201cWe shall be there in a minute,\u201d Mrs. Arbuthnot said to herself, holding on.\n\n\u201cWe shall soon stop now,\u201d Mrs. Wilkins said to herself, holding on. They said nothing aloud, because nothing would have been heard above the whip-cracking and the wheel-clattering and the boisterous inciting noises Beppo was making at his horse.\n\nAnxiously they strained their eyes for any sight of the beginning of San Salvatore.\n\nThey had supposed and hoped that after a reasonable amount of village a mediaeval archway would loom upon them, and through it they would drive into a garden and draw up at an open, welcoming door, with light streaming from it and those servants standing in it who, according to the advertisement, remained.\n\nInstead the fly suddenly stopped.\n\nPeering out they could see they were still in the village street, with small dark houses each side; and Beppo, throwing the reins over the horse\u2019s back as if completely confident this time that he would not go any farther, got down off his box. At the same moment, springing as it seemed out of nothing, a man and several half-grown boys appeared on each side of the fly and began dragging out the suit-cases.\n\n\u201cNo, no\u2014San Salvatore, San Salvatore\u201d\u2014exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins, trying to hold on to what suit-cases she could.\n\n\u201cS\xec, s\xec\u2014San Salvatore,\u201d they all shouted, pulling.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be San Salvatore,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, turning to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who sat quite still watching her suit-cases being taken from her with the same patience she applied to lesser evils. She knew she could do nothing if these men were wicked men determined to have her suit-cases.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it can be,\u201d she admitted, and could not refrain from a moment\u2019s wonder at the ways of God. Had she really been brought here, she and poor Mrs. Wilkins, after so much trouble in arranging it, so much difficulty and worry, along such devious paths of prevarication and deceit, only to be\u2014\n\nShe checked her thoughts, and gently said to Mrs. Wilkins, while the ragged youths disappeared with the suit-cases into the night and the man with the lantern helped Beppo pull the rug off her, that they were both in God\u2019s hands; and for the first time on hearing this, Mrs. Wilkins was afraid.\n\nThere was nothing for it but to get out. Useless to try to go on sitting in the fly repeating San Salvatore. Every time they said it, and their voices each time were fainter, Beppo and the other man merely echoed it in a series of loud shouts. If only they had learned Italian when they were little. If only they could have said, \u201cWe wish to be driven to the door.\u201d But they did not even know what door was in Italian. Such ignorance was not only contemptible, it was, they now saw, definitely dangerous. Useless, however, to lament it now. Useless to put off whatever it was that was going to happen to them by trying to go on sitting in the fly. They therefore got out.\n\nThe two men opened their umbrellas for them and handed them to them. From this they received a faint encouragement, because they could not believe that if these men were wicked they would pause to open umbrellas. The man with the lantern then made signs to them to follow him, talking loud and quickly, and Beppo, they noticed, remained behind. Ought they to pay him? Not, they thought, if they were going to be robbed and perhaps murdered. Surely on such an occasion one did not pay. Besides, he had not after all brought them to San Salvatore. Where they had got to was evidently somewhere else. Also, he did not show the least wish to be paid; he let them go away into the night with no clamour at all. This, they could not help thinking, was a bad sign. He asked for nothing because presently he was to get so much.\n\nThey came to some steps. The road ended abruptly in a church and some descending steps. The man held the lantern low for them to see the steps.\n\n\u201cSan Salvatore?\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins once again, very faintly, before committing herself to the steps. It was useless to mention it now, of course, but she could not go down steps in complete silence. No mediaeval castle, she was sure, was ever built at the bottom of steps.\n\nAgain, however, came the echoing shout\u2014\u201cS\xec, s\xec\u2014San Salvatore.\u201d\n\nThey descended gingerly, holding up their skirts just as if they would be wanting them another time and had not in all probability finished with skirts for ever.\n\nThe steps ended in a steeply sloping path with flat stone slabs down the middle. They slipped a good deal on these wet slabs, and the man with the lantern, talking loud and quickly, held them up. His way of holding them up was polite.\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins in a low voice to Mrs. Arbuthnot, \u201cIt is all right after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in God\u2019s hands,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot again; and again Mrs. Wilkins was afraid.\n\nThey reached the bottom of the sloping path, and the light of the lantern flickered over an open space with houses round three sides. The sea was the fourth side, lazily washing backwards and forwards on pebbles.\n\n\u201cSan Salvatore,\u201d said the man pointing with his lantern to a black mass curved round the water like an arm flung about it.\n\nThey strained their eyes. They saw the black mass, and on the top of it a light.\n\n\u201cSan Salvatore?\u201d they both repeated incredulously, for where were the suit-cases, and why had they been forced to get out of the fly?\n\n\u201cS\xec, s\xec\u2014San Salvatore.\u201d\n\nThey went along what seemed to be a quay, right on the edge of the water. There was not even a low wall here\u2014nothing to prevent the man with the lantern tipping them in if he wanted to. He did not, however, tip them in. Perhaps it was all right after all, Mrs. Wilkins again suggested to Mrs. Arbuthnot on noticing this, who this time was herself beginning to think that it might be, and said no more about God\u2019s hands.\n\nThe flicker of the lantern danced along, reflected in the wet pavement of the quay. Out to the left, in the darkness and evidently at the end of a jetty, was a red light. They came to an archway with a heavy iron gate. The man with the lantern pushed the gate open. This time they went up steps instead of down, and at the top of them was a little path that wound upwards among flowers. They could not see the flowers, but the whole place was evidently full of them.\n\nIt here dawned on Mrs. Wilkins that perhaps the reason why the fly had not driven them up to the door was that there was no road, only a footpath. That also would explain the disappearance of the suit-cases. She began to feel confident that they would find their suit-cases waiting for them when they got up to the top. San Salvatore was, it seemed, on the top of a hill, as a mediaeval castle should be. At a turn of the path they saw above them, much nearer now and shining more brightly, the light they had seen from the quay. She told Mrs. Arbuthnot of her dawning belief, and Mrs. Arbuthnot agreed that it was very likely a true one.\n\nOnce more, but this time in a tone of real hopefulness, Mrs. Wilkins said, pointing upwards at the black outline against the only slightly less black sky, \u201cSan Salvatore?\u201d And once more, but this time comfortingly, encouragingly, came back the assurance, \u201cS\xec, s\xec\u2014San Salvatore.\u201d\n\nThey crossed a little bridge, over what was apparently a ravine, and then came a flat bit with long grass at the sides and more flowers. They felt the grass flicking wet against their stockings, and the invisible flowers were everywhere. Then up again through trees, along a zigzag path with the smell all the way of the flowers they could not see. The warm rain was bringing out all the sweetness. Higher and higher they went in this sweet darkness, and the red light on the jetty dropped farther and farther below them.\n\nThe path wound round to the other side of what appeared to be a little peninsula; the jetty and the red light disappeared; across the emptiness on their left were distant lights.\n\n\u201cMezzago,\u201d said the man, waving his lantern at the lights.\n\n\u201cS\xec, s\xec,\u201d they answered, for they had by now learned \u201cs\xec, s\xec\u201d. Upon which the man congratulated them in a great flow of polite words, not one of which they understood, on their magnificent Italian; for this was Domenico, the vigilant and accomplished gardener of San Salvatore, the prop and stay of the establishment, the resourceful, the gifted, the eloquent, the courteous, the intelligent Domenico. Only they did not know that yet; and he did in the dark, and even sometimes in the light, look, with his knife-sharp swarthy features and swift, panther movements, very like somebody wicked.\n\nThey passed along another flat bit of path, with a black shape like a high wall towering above them on their right, and then the path went up again under trellises, and trailing sprays of scented things caught at them and shook raindrops on them, and the light of the lantern flickered over lilies, and then came a flight of ancient steps worn with centuries, and then another iron gate, and then they were inside, though still climbing a twisting flight of stone steps with old walls on either side like the walls of dungeons, and with a vaulted roof.\n\nAt the top was a wrought-iron door, and through it shone a flood of electric light.\n\n\u201cEcco,\u201d said Domenico, lithely running up the last few steps ahead and pushing the door open.\n\nAnd there they were, arrived; and it was San Salvatore; and their suit-cases were waiting for them; and they had not been murdered.\n\nThey looked at each other\u2019s white faces and blinking eyes very solemnly.\n\nIt was a great, a wonderful moment. Here they were, in their mediaeval castle at last. Their feet touched its stones.\n\nMrs. Wilkins put her arm round Mrs. Arbuthnot\u2019s neck and kissed her.\n\n\u201cThe first thing to happen in this house,\u201d she said softly, solemnly, \u201cshall be a kiss.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear Lotty,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\u201cDear Rose,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, her eyes brimming with gladness.\n\nDomenico was delighted. He liked to see beautiful ladies kiss. He made them a most appreciative speech of welcome, and they stood arm in arm, holding each other up, for they were very tired, blinking smilingly at him, and not understanding a word.\nChapter 6\n\nWhen Mrs. Wilkins woke next morning she lay in bed a few minutes before getting up and opening the shutters. What would she see out of her window? A shining world, or a world of rain? But it would be beautiful; whatever it was would be beautiful.\n\nShe was in a little bedroom with bare white walls and a stone floor and sparse old furniture. The beds\u2014there were two\u2014were made of iron, enamelled black and painted with bunches of gay flowers. She lay putting off the great moment of going to the window as one puts off opening a precious letter, gloating over it. She had no idea what time it was; she had forgotten to wind up her watch ever since, centuries ago, she last went to bed in Hampstead. No sounds were to be heard in the house, so she supposed it was very early, yet she felt as if she had slept a long while\u2014so completely rested, so perfectly content. She lay with her arms clasped round her head thinking how happy she was, her lips curved upwards in a delighted smile. In bed by herself: adorable condition. She had not been in a bed without Mellersh once now for five whole years; and the cool roominess of it, the freedom of one\u2019s movements, the sense of recklessness, of audacity, in giving the blankets a pull if one wanted to, or twitching the pillows more comfortably! It was like the discovery of an entirely new joy.\n\nMrs. Wilkins longed to get up and open the shutters, but where she was was really so very delicious. She gave a sigh of contentment, and went on lying there looking round her, taking in everything in her room, her own little room, her very own to arrange just as she pleased for this one blessed month, her room bought with her own savings, the fruit of her careful denials, whose door she could bolt if she wanted to, and nobody had the right to come in. It was such a strange little room, so different from any she had known, and so sweet. It was like a cell. Except for the two beds, it suggested a happy austerity. \u201cAnd the name of the chamber,\u201d she thought, quoting and smiling round at it, \u201cwas Peace.\u201d\n\nWell, this was delicious, to lie there thinking how happy she was, but outside those shutters it was more delicious still. She jumped up, pulled on her slippers, for there was nothing on the stone floor but one small rug, ran to the window and threw open the shutters.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d cried Mrs. Wilkins.\n\nAll the radiance of April in Italy lay gathered together at her feet. The sun poured in on her. The sea lay asleep in it, hardly stirring. Across the bay the lovely mountains, exquisitely different in colour, were asleep too in the light; and underneath her window, at the bottom of the flower-starred grass slope from which the wall of the castle rose up, was a great cypress, cutting through the delicate blues and violets and rose-colours of the mountains and the sea like a great black sword.\n\nShe stared. Such beauty; and she there to see it. Such beauty; and she alive to feel it. Her face was bathed in light. Lovely scents came up to the window and caressed her. A tiny breeze gently lifted her hair. Far out in the bay a cluster of almost motionless fishing boats hovered like a flock of white birds on the tranquil sea. How beautiful, how beautiful. Not to have died before this . . . to have been allowed to see, breathe, feel this. . . . She stared, her lips parted. Happy? Poor, ordinary, everyday word. But what could one say, how could one describe it? It was as though she could hardly stay inside herself, it was as though she were too small to hold so much of joy, it was as though she were washed through with light. And how astonishing to feel this sheer bliss, for here she was, not doing and not going to do a single unselfish thing, not going to do a thing she didn\u2019t want to do. According to everybody she had ever come across she ought at least to have twinges. She had not one twinge. Something was wrong somewhere. Wonderful that at home she should have been so good, so terribly good, and merely felt tormented. Twinges of every sort had there been her portion; aches, hurts, discouragements, and she the whole time being steadily unselfish. Now she had taken off all her goodness and left it behind her like a heap of rain-sodden clothes, and she only felt joy. She was naked of goodness, and was rejoicing in being naked. She was stripped, and exulting. And there, away in the dim mugginess of Hampstead, was Mellersh being angry.\n\nShe tried to visualise Mellersh, she tried to see him having breakfast and thinking bitter things about her; and lo, Mellersh himself began to shimmer, became rose-colour, became delicate violet, became an enchanting blue, became formless, became iridescent. Actually Mellersh, after quivering a minute, was lost in light.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d thought Mrs. Wilkins, staring, as it were, after him. How extraordinary not to be able to visualise Mellersh; and she who used to know every feature, every expression of his by heart. She simply could not see him as he was. She could only see him resolved into beauty, melted into harmony with everything else. The familiar words of the General Thanksgiving came quite naturally into her mind, and she found herself blessing God for her creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life, but above all for His inestimable Love; out loud; in a burst of acknowledgment. While Mellersh, at that moment angrily pulling on his boots before going out into the dripping streets, was indeed thinking bitter things about her.\n\nShe began to dress, choosing clean white clothes in honour of the summer\u2019s day, unpacking her suit-cases, tidying her adorable little room. She moved about with quick, purposeful steps, her long thin body held up straight, her small face, so much puckered at home with effort and fear, smoothed out. All she had been and done before this morning, all she had felt and worried about, was gone. Each of her worries behaved as the image of Mellersh had behaved, and dissolved into colour and light. And she noticed things she had not noticed for years\u2014when she was doing her hair in front of the glass she noticed it, and thought, \u201cWhy, what pretty stuff.\u201d For years she had forgotten she had such a thing as hair, plaiting it in the evening and unplaiting it in the morning with the same hurry and indifference with which she laced and unlaced her shoes. Now she suddenly saw it, and she twisted it round her fingers before the glass, and was glad it was so pretty. Mellersh couldn\u2019t have seen it either, for he had never said a word about it. Well, when she got home she would draw his attention to it. \u201cMellersh,\u201d she would say, \u201clook at my hair. Aren\u2019t you pleased you\u2019ve got a wife with hair like curly honey?\u201d\n\nShe laughed. She had never said anything like that to Mellersh yet, and the idea of it amused her. But why had she not? Oh yes\u2014she used to be afraid of him. Funny to be afraid of anybody; and especially of one\u2019s husband, whom one saw in his more simplified moments, such as asleep, and not breathing properly through his nose.\n\nWhen she was ready she opened her door to go across to see if Rose, who had been put the night before by a sleepy maidservant into a cell opposite, were awake. She would say good-morning to her, and then she would run down and stay with that cypress tree till breakfast was ready, and after breakfast she wouldn\u2019t so much as look out of a window till she had helped Rose get everything ready for Lady Caroline and Mrs. Fisher. There was much to be done that day, settling in, arranging the rooms; she mustn\u2019t leave Rose to do it alone. They would make it all so lovely for the two to come, have such an entrancing vision ready for them of little cells bright with flowers. She remembered she had wanted Lady Caroline not to come; fancy wanting to shut some one out of heaven because she thought she would be shy of her! And as though it mattered if she were, and as though she would be anything so self-conscious as shy. Besides, what a reason. She could not accuse herself of goodness over that. And she remembered she had wanted not to have Mrs. Fisher either, because she had seemed lofty. How funny of her. So funny to worry about such little things, making them important.\n\nThe bedrooms and two of the sitting-rooms at San Salvatore were on the top floor, and opened into a roomy hall with a wide glass window at the north end. San Salvatore was rich in small gardens in different parts and on different levels. The garden this window looked down on was made on the highest part of the walls, and could only be reached through the corresponding spacious hall on the floor below. When Mrs. Wilkins came out of her room this window stood wide open, and beyond it in the sun was a Judas tree in full flower. There was no sign of anybody, no sound of voices or feet. Tubs of arum lilies stood about on the stone floor, and on a table flamed a huge bunch of fierce nasturtiums. Spacious, flowery, silent, with the wide window at the end opening into the garden, and the Judas tree absurdly beautiful in the sunshine, it seemed to Mrs. Wilkins, arrested on her way across to Mrs. Arbuthnot, too good to be true. Was she really going to live in this for a whole month? Up to now she had had to take what beauty she could as she went along, snatching at little bits of it when she came across it\u2014a patch of daisies on a fine day in a Hampstead field, a flash of sunset between two chimney pots. She had never been in definitely, completely beautiful places. She had never been even in a venerable house; and such a thing as a profusion of flowers in her rooms was unattainable to her. Sometimes in the spring she had bought six tulips at Shoolbred\u2019s, unable to resist them, conscious that Mellersh if he knew what they had cost would think it inexcusable; but they had soon died, and then there were no more. As for the Judas tree, she hadn\u2019t an idea what it was, and gazed at it out there against the sky with the rapt expression of one who sees a heavenly vision.\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot, coming out of her room, found her there like that, standing in the middle of the hall staring.\n\n\u201cNow what does she think she sees now?\u201d thought Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\u201cWe are in God\u2019s hands,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, turning to her, speaking with extreme conviction.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot quickly, her face, which had been covered with smiles when she came out of her room, falling. \u201cWhy, what has happened?\u201d\n\nFor Mrs. Arbuthnot had woken up with such a delightful feeling of security, of relief, and she did not want to find she had not after all escaped from the need of refuge. She had not even dreamed of Frederick. For the first time for years she had been spared the nightly dream that he was with her, that they were heart to heart, and its miserable awakening. She had slept like a baby, and had woken up confident; she had found there was nothing she wished to say in her morning prayer except Thank you. It was disconcerting to be told she was after all in God\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cI hope nothing has happened?\u201d she asked anxiously.\n\nMrs. Wilkins looked at her a moment, and laughed. \u201cHow funny,\u201d she said, kissing her.\n\n\u201cWhat is funny?\u201d asked Mrs. Arbuthnot, her face clearing because Mrs. Wilkins laughed.\n\n\u201cWe are. This is. Everything. It\u2019s all so wonderful. It\u2019s so funny and so adorable that we should be in it. I daresay when we finally reach heaven\u2014the one they talk about so much\u2014we shan\u2019t find it a bit more beautiful.\u201d\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot relaxed to smiling security again. \u201cIsn\u2019t it divine?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWere you ever, ever in your life so happy?\u201d asked Mrs. Wilkins, catching her by the arm.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot. Nor had she been; not ever; not even in her first love-days with Frederick. Because always pain had been close at hand in that other happiness, ready to torture with doubts, to torture even with the very excess of her love; while this was the simple happiness of complete harmony with her surroundings, the happiness that asks for nothing, that just accepts, just breathes, just is.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go and look at that tree close,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it can only be a tree.\u201d\n\nAnd arm in arm they went along the hall, and their husbands would not have known them their faces were so young with eagerness, and together they stood at the open window, and when their eyes, having feasted on the marvellous pink thing, wandered farther among the beauties of the garden, they saw sitting on the low wall at the east edge of it, gazing out over the bay, her feet in lilies, Lady Caroline.\n\nThey were astonished. They said nothing in their astonishment, but stood quite still, arm in arm, staring down at her.\n\nShe too had on a white frock, and her head was bare. They had had no idea that day in London, when her hat was down to her nose and her furs were up to her ears, that she was so pretty. They had merely thought her different from the other women in the club, and so had the other women themselves, and so had all the waitresses, eyeing her sideways and eyeing her again as they passed the corner where she sat talking; but they had had no idea she was so pretty. She was exceedingly pretty. Everything about her was very much that which it was. Her fair hair was very fair, her lovely grey eyes were very lovely and grey, her dark eyelashes were very dark, her white skin was very white, her red mouth was very red. She was extravagantly slender\u2014the merest thread of a girl, though not without little curves beneath her thin frock where little curves should be. She was looking out across the bay, and was sharply defined against the background of empty blue. She was full in the sun. Her feet dangled among the leaves and flowers of the lilies just as if it did not matter that they should be bent or bruised.\n\n\u201cShe ought to have a headache,\u201d whispered Mrs. Arbuthnot at last, \u201csitting there in the sun like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe ought to have a hat,\u201d whispered Mrs. Wilkins.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s treading on lilies.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re hers as much as ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly one-fourth of them.\u201d\n\nLady Caroline turned her head. She looked up at them a moment, surprised to see them so much younger than they had seemed that day at the club, and so much less unattractive. Indeed, they were really almost quite attractive, if any one could ever be really quite attractive in the wrong clothes. Her eyes, swiftly glancing over them, took in every inch of each of them in the half second before she smiled and waved her hand and called out Good-morning. There was nothing, she saw at once, to be hoped for in the way of interest from their clothes. She did not consciously think this, for she was having a violent reaction against beautiful clothes and the slavery they impose on one, her experience being that the instant one had got them they took one in hand and gave one no peace till they had been everywhere and been seen by everybody. You didn\u2019t take your clothes to parties; they took you. It was quite a mistake to think that a woman, a really well-dressed woman, wore out her clothes; it was the clothes that wore out the woman\u2014dragging her about at all hours of the day and night. No wonder men stayed young longer. Just new trousers couldn\u2019t excite them. She couldn\u2019t suppose that even the newest trousers ever behaved like that, taking the bit between their teeth. Her images were disorderly, but she thought as she chose, she used what images she liked. As she got off the wall and came towards the window, it seemed a restful thing to know she was going to spend an entire month with people in dresses made as she dimly remembered dresses used to be made five summers ago.\n\n\u201cI got here yesterday morning,\u201d she said, looking up at them and smiling. She really was bewitching. She had everything, even a dimple.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great pity,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot, smiling back, \u201cbecause we were going to choose the nicest room for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, but I\u2019ve done that,\u201d said Lady Caroline. \u201cAt least, I think it\u2019s the nicest. It looks two ways\u2014I adore a room that looks two ways, don\u2019t you? Over the sea to the west, and over this Judas tree to the north.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we had meant to make it pretty for you with flowers,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins.\n\n\u201cOh, Domenico did that. I told him to directly I got here. He\u2019s the gardener. He\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing, of course,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot a little hesitatingly, \u201cto be independent, and to know exactly what one wants.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it saves trouble,\u201d agreed Lady Caroline.\n\n\u201cBut one shouldn\u2019t be so independent,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, \u201cas to leave no opportunity for other people to exercise their benevolences on one.\u201d\n\nLady Caroline, who had been looking at Mrs. Arbuthnot, now looked at Mrs. Wilkins. That day at that queer club she had had merely a blurred impression of Mrs. Wilkins, for it was the other one who did all the talking, and her impression had been of somebody so shy, so awkward that it was best to take no notice of her. She had not even been able to say good-bye properly, doing it in an agony, turning red, turning damp. Therefore she now looked at her in some surprise; and she was still more surprised when Mrs. Wilkins added, gazing at her with the most obvious sincere admiration, speaking indeed with a conviction that refused to remain unuttered, \u201cI didn\u2019t realise you were so pretty.\u201d\n\nShe stared at Mrs. Wilkins. She was not usually told this quite so immediately and roundly. Abundantly as she was used to it\u2014impossible not to be after twenty-eight solid years\u2014it surprised her to be told it with such bluntness, and by a woman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you to think so,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhy, you\u2019re lovely,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins. \u201cQuite, quite lovely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot pleasantly, \u201cyou make the most of it.\u201d\n\nLady Caroline then stared at Mrs. Arbuthnot. \u201cOh yes,\u201d she said. \u201cI make the most of it. I\u2019ve been doing that ever since I can remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot, smiling and raising a warning forefinger, \u201cit won\u2019t last.\u201d\n\nThen Lady Caroline began to be afraid these two were originals. If so, she would be bored. Nothing bored her so much as people who insisted on being original, who came and buttonholed her and kept her waiting while they were being original. And the one who admired her\u2014it would be tiresome if she dogged her about in order to look at her. What she wanted of this holiday was complete escape from all she had had before, she wanted the rest of complete contrast. Being admired, being dogged, wasn\u2019t contrast, it was repetition; and as for originals, to find herself shut up with two on the top of a precipitous hill in a mediaeval castle built for the express purpose of preventing easy goings out and in, would not, she was afraid, be especially restful. Perhaps she had better be a little less encouraging. They had seemed such timid creatures, even the dark one\u2014she couldn\u2019t remember their names\u2014that day at the club, that she had felt it quite safe to be very friendly. Here they had come out of their shells; already; indeed, at once. There was no sign of timidity about either of them here. If they had got out of their shells so immediately, at the very first contact, unless she checked them they would soon begin to press upon her, and then good-bye to her dream of thirty restful, silent days, lying unmolested in the sun, getting her feathers smooth again, not being spoken to, not waited on, not grabbed at and monopolised, but just recovering from the fatigue, the deep and melancholy fatigue, of the too much.\n\nBesides, there was Mrs. Fisher. She too must be checked. Lady Caroline had started two days earlier than had been arranged for two reasons: first, because she wished to arrive before the others in order to pick out the room or rooms she preferred, and second, because she judged it likely that otherwise she would have to travel with Mrs. Fisher. She did not want to travel with Mrs. Fisher. She did not want to arrive with Mrs. Fisher. She saw no reason whatever why for a single moment she should have to have anything at all to do with Mrs. Fisher.\n\nBut unfortunately Mrs. Fisher also was filled with a desire to get to San Salvatore first and pick out the room or rooms she preferred, and she and Lady Caroline had after all travelled together. As early as Calais they began to suspect it; in Paris they feared it; at Modane they knew it; at Mezzago they concealed it, driving out to Castagneto in two separate flys, the nose of the one almost touching the back of the other the whole way. But when the road suddenly left off at the church and the steps, further evasion was impossible; and faced by this abrupt and difficult finish to their journey there was nothing for it but to amalgamate.\n\nBecause of Mrs. Fisher\u2019s stick Lady Caroline had to see about everything. Mrs. Fisher\u2019s intentions, she explained from her fly when the situation had become plain to her, were active, but her stick prevented their being carried out. The two drivers told Lady Caroline boys would have to carry the luggage up to the castle, and she went in search of some, while Mrs. Fisher waited in the fly because of her stick. Mrs. Fisher could speak Italian, but only, she explained, the Italian of Dante, which Matthew Arnold used to read with her when she was a girl, and she thought this might be above the heads of boys. Therefore Lady Caroline, who spoke ordinary Italian very well, was obviously the one to go and do things.\n\n\u201cI am in your hands,\u201d said Mrs. Fisher, sitting firmly in her fly. \u201cYou must please regard me as merely an old woman with a stick.\u201d\n\nAnd presently, down the steps and cobbles to the piazza, and along the quay, and up the zigzag path, Lady Caroline found herself as much obliged to walk slowly with Mrs. Fisher as if she were her own grandmother.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my stick,\u201d Mrs. Fisher complacently remarked at intervals.\n\nAnd when they rested at those bends of the zigzag path where seats were, and Lady Caroline, who would have liked to run on and get to the top quickly, was forced in common humanity to remain with Mrs. Fisher because of her stick, Mrs. Fisher told her how she had been on a zigzag path once with Tennyson.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t his cricket wonderful?\u201d said Lady Caroline absently.\n\n\u201cThe Tennyson,\u201d said Mrs. Fisher, turning her head and observing her a moment over her spectacles.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he?\u201d said Lady Caroline.\n\n\u201cI am speaking,\u201d said Mrs. Fisher, \u201cof Alfred.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Lady Caroline.\n\n\u201cAnd it was a path, too,\u201d Mrs. Fisher went on severely, \u201ccuriously like this. No eucalyptus tree, of course, but otherwise curiously like this. And at one of the bends he turned and said to me\u2014I see him now turning and saying to me\u2014\u201d\n\nYes, Mrs. Fisher would have to be checked. And so would these two up at the window. She had better begin at once. She was sorry she had got off the wall. All she need have done was to have waved her hand, and waited till they came down and out into the garden to her.\n\nSo she ignored Mrs. Arbuthnot\u2019s remark and raised forefinger, and said with marked coldness\u2014at least, she tried to make it sound marked\u2014that she supposed they would be going to breakfast, and that she had had hers; but it was her fate that however coldly she sent forth her words they came out sounding quite warm and agreeable. That was because she had a sympathetic and delightful voice, due entirely to some special formation of her throat and the roof of her mouth, and having nothing whatever to do with what she was feeling. Nobody in consequence ever believed they were being snubbed. It was most tiresome. And if she stared icily it did not look icy at all, because her eyes, lovely to begin with, had the added loveliness of very long, soft, dark eyelashes. No icy stare could come out of eyes like that; it got caught and lost in the soft eyelashes, and the persons stared at merely thought they were being regarded with a flattering and exquisite attentiveness. And if ever she was out of humour or definitely cross\u2014and who would not be sometimes in such a world?\u2014she only looked so pathetic that people all rushed to comfort her, if possible by means of kissing. It was more than tiresome, it was maddening. Nature was determined that she should look and sound angelic. She could never be disagreeable or rude without being completely misunderstood.\n\n\u201cI had my breakfast in my room,\u201d she said, trying her utmost to sound curt. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n\nAnd she nodded, and went back to where she had been sitting on the wall, with the lilies being nice and cool round her feet.\nChapter 7\n\nTheir eyes followed her admiringly. They had no idea they had been snubbed. It was a disappointment, of course, to find she had forestalled them and that they were not to have the happiness of preparing for her, of watching her face when she arrived and first saw everything, but there was still Mrs. Fisher. They would concentrate on Mrs. Fisher, and would watch her face instead; only, like everybody else, they would have preferred to watch Lady Caroline\u2019s.\n\nPerhaps, then, as Lady Caroline had talked of breakfast, they had better begin by going and having it, for there was too much to be done that day to spend any more time gazing at the scenery\u2014servants to be interviewed, the house to be gone through and examined, and finally Mrs. Fisher\u2019s room to be got ready and adorned.\n\nThey waved their hands gaily at Lady Caroline, who seemed absorbed in what she saw and took no notice, and turning away found the maidservant of the night before had come up silently behind them in cloth slippers with string soles.\n\nShe was Francesca, the elderly parlour-maid, who had been with the owner, he had said, for years, and whose presence made inventories unnecessary; and after wishing them good-morning and hoping they had slept well, she told them breakfast was ready in the dining-room on the floor below, and if they would follow her she would lead.\n\nThey did not understand a single word of the very many in which Francesca succeeded in clothing this simple information, but they followed her, for it at least was clear that they were to follow, and going down the stairs, and along the broad hall like the one above except for glass doors at the end instead of a window opening into the garden, they were shown into the dining-room; where, sitting at the head of the table having her breakfast, was Mrs. Fisher.\n\nThis time they exclaimed. Even Mrs. Arbuthnot exclaimed, though her exclamation was only \u201cOh.\u201d\n\nMrs. Wilkins exclaimed at greater length. \u201cWhy, but it\u2019s like having the bread taken out of one\u2019s mouth!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins.\n\n\u201cHow do you do,\u201d said Mrs. Fisher. \u201cI can\u2019t get up because of my stick.\u201d And she stretched out her hand across the table.\n\nThey advanced and shook it.\n\n\u201cWe had no idea you were here,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Mrs. Fisher, resuming her breakfast. \u201cYes. I am here.\u201d And with composure she removed the top of her egg.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great disappointment,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins. \u201cWe had meant to give you such a welcome.\u201d\n\nThis was the one, Mrs. Fisher remembered, briefly glancing at her, who when she came to Prince of Wales Terrace said she had seen Keats. She must be careful with this one\u2014curb her from the beginning.\n\nShe therefore ignored Mrs. Wilkins and said gravely, with a downward face of impenetrable calm bent on her egg, \u201cYes. I arrived yesterday with Lady Caroline.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really dreadful,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, exactly as if she had not been ignored. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody left to get anything ready for now. I feel thwarted. I feel as if the bread had been taken out of my mouth just when I was going to be happy swallowing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere will you sit?\u201d asked Mrs. Fisher of Mrs. Arbuthnot\u2014markedly of Mrs. Arbuthnot; the comparison with the bread seemed to her most unpleasant.\n\n\u201cOh, thank you\u2014\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot, sitting down rather suddenly next to her.\n\nThere were only two places she could sit down in, the places laid on either side of Mrs. Fisher. She therefore sat down in one, and Mrs. Wilkins sat down opposite her in the other.\n\nMrs. Fisher was at the head of the table. Round her was grouped the coffee and the tea. Of course they were all sharing San Salvatore equally, but it was she herself and Lotty, Mrs. Arbuthnot mildly reflected, who had found it, who had had the work of getting it, who had chosen to admit Mrs. Fisher into it. Without them, she could not help thinking, Mrs. Fisher would not have been there. Morally Mrs. Fisher was a guest. There was no hostess in this party, but supposing there had been a hostess it would not have been Mrs. Fisher, nor Lady Caroline, it would have been either herself or Lotty. Mrs. Arbuthnot could not help feeling this as she sat down, and Mrs. Fisher, the hand which Ruskin had wrung suspended over the pots before her, inquired, \u201cTea or coffee?\u201d She could not help feeling it even more definitely when Mrs. Fisher touched a small gong on the table beside her as though she had been used to that gong and that table ever since she was little, and, on Francesca\u2019s appearing, bade her in the language of Dante bring more milk. There was a curious air about Mrs. Fisher, thought Mrs. Arbuthnot, of being in possession; and if she herself had not been so happy she would have perhaps minded.\n\nMrs. Wilkins noticed it too, but it only made her discursive brain think of cuckoos. She would no doubt immediately have begun to talk of cuckoos, incoherently, unrestrainably and deplorably, if she had been in the condition of nerves and shyness she was in last time she saw Mrs. Fisher. But happiness had done away with shyness\u2014she was very serene; she could control her conversation; she did not have, horrified, to listen to herself saying things she had no idea of saying when she began; she was quite at her ease, and completely natural. The disappointment of not going to be able to prepare a welcome for Mrs. Fisher had evaporated at once, for it was impossible to go on being disappointed in heaven. Nor did she mind her behaving as hostess. What did it matter? You did not mind things in heaven. She and Mrs. Arbuthnot, therefore, sat down more willingly than they otherwise would have done, one on either side of Mrs. Fisher, and the sun, pouring through the two windows facing east across the bay, flooded the room, and there was an open door leading into the garden, and the garden was full of many lovely things, especially freesias.\n\nThe delicate and delicious fragrance of the freesias came in through the door and floated round Mrs. Wilkins\u2019s enraptured nostrils. Freesias in London were quite beyond her. Occasionally she went into a shop and asked what they cost, so as just to have an excuse for lifting up a bunch and smelling them, well knowing that it was something awful like a shilling for about three flowers. Here they were everywhere\u2014bursting out of every corner and carpeting the rose beds. Imagine it\u2014having freesias to pick in armsful if you wanted to, and with glorious sunshine flooding the room, and in your summer frock, and its being only the first of April!\n\n\u201cI suppose you realise, don\u2019t you, that we\u2019ve got to heaven?\u201d she said, beaming at Mrs. Fisher with all the familiarity of a fellow-angel.\n\n\u201cThey are considerably younger than I had supposed,\u201d thought Mrs. Fisher, \u201cand not nearly so plain.\u201d And she mused a moment, while she took no notice of Mrs. Wilkins\u2019s exuberance, on their instant and agitated refusal that day at Prince of Wales Terrace to have anything to do with the giving or the taking of references.\n\nNothing could affect her, of course; nothing that anybody did. She was far too solidly seated in respectability. At her back stood massively in a tremendous row those three great names she had offered, and they were not the only ones she could turn to for support and countenance. Even if these young women\u2014she had no grounds for believing the one out in the garden to be really Lady Caroline Dester, she had merely been told she was\u2014even if these young women should all turn out to be what Browning used to call\u2014how well she remembered his amusing and delightful way of putting things\u2014Fly-by-Nights, what could it possibly, or in any way matter to her? Let them fly by night if they wished. One was not sixty-five for nothing. In any case there would only be four weeks of it, at the end of which she would see no more of them. And in the meanwhile there were plenty of places where she could sit quietly away from them and remember. Also there was her own sitting-room, a charming room, all honey-coloured furniture and pictures, with windows to the sea towards Genoa, and a door opening on to the battlements. The house possessed two sitting-rooms, and she had explained to that pretty creature Lady Caroline\u2014certainly a pretty creature, whatever else she was; Tennyson would have enjoyed taking her for blows on the downs\u2014who had seemed inclined to appropriate the honey-coloured one, that she needed some little refuge entirely to herself because of her stick.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to see an old woman hobbling about everywhere,\u201d she had said. \u201cI shall be quite content to spend much of my time by myself in here or sitting out on these convenient battlements.\u201d\n\nAnd she had a very nice bedroom, too; it looked two ways, across the bay to the morning sun\u2014she liked the morning sun\u2014and onto the garden. There were only two of these bedrooms with cross-views in the house, she and Lady Caroline had discovered, and they were by far the airiest. They each had two beds in them, and she and Lady Caroline had had the extra beds taken out at once and put into two of the other rooms. In this way there was much more space and comfort. Lady Caroline, indeed, had turned hers into a bed-sitting-room, with the sofa out of the bigger drawing-room and the writing-table and the most comfortable chair, but she herself had not had to do that because she had her own sitting-room, equipped with what was necessary. Lady Caroline had thought at first of taking the bigger sitting-room entirely for her own, because the dining-room on the floor below could quite well be used between meals to sit in by the two others, and was a very pleasant room with nice chairs, but she had not liked the bigger sitting-room\u2019s shape\u2014it was a round room in the tower, with deep slit windows pierced through the massive walls, and a domed and ribbed ceiling arranged to look like an open umbrella, and it seemed a little dark. Undoubtedly Lady Caroline had cast covetous glances at the honey-coloured room, and if she, Mrs. Fisher, had been less firm would have installed herself in it. Which would have been absurd.\n\n\u201cI hope,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot, smilingly making an attempt to convey to Mrs. Fisher that though she, Mrs. Fisher, might not be exactly a guest she certainly was not in the very least a hostess, \u201cyour room is comfortable.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite,\u201d said Mrs. Fisher. \u201cWill you have some more coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank you. Will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank you. There were two beds in my bedroom, filling it up unnecessarily, and I had one taken out. It has made it much more convenient.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh that\u2019s why I\u2019ve got two beds in my room!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins, illuminated; the second bed in her little cell had seemed an unnatural and inappropriate object from the moment she saw it.\n\n\u201cI gave no directions,\u201d said Mrs. Fisher, addressing Mrs. Arbuthnot, \u201cI merely asked Francesca to remove it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have two in my room as well,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\u201cYour second one must be Lady Caroline\u2019s. She had hers removed too,\u201d said Mrs. Fisher. \u201cIt seems foolish to have more beds in a room than there are occupiers.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we haven\u2019t got any husbands here either,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, \u201cand I don\u2019t see any use in extra beds in one\u2019s room if one hasn\u2019t got husbands to put in them. Can\u2019t we have them taken away too?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeds,\u201d said Mrs. Fisher coldly, \u201ccannot be removed from one room after another. They must remain somewhere.\u201d\n\nMrs. Wilkins\u2019s remarks seemed to Mrs. Fisher persistently unfortunate. Each time she opened her mouth she said something best left unsaid. Loose talk about husbands had never in Mrs. Fisher\u2019s circle been encouraged. In the \u2019eighties, when she chiefly flourished, husbands were taken seriously, as the only real obstacles to sin. Beds too, if they had to be mentioned, were approached with caution; and a decent reserve prevented them and husbands ever being spoken of in the same breath.\n\nShe turned more markedly than ever to Mrs. Arbuthnot. \u201cDo let me give you a little more coffee,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNo, thank you. But won\u2019t you have some more?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo indeed. I never have more than two cups at breakfast. Would you like an orange?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank you. Would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t eat fruit at breakfast. It is an American fashion which I am too old now to adopt. Have you had all you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite. Have you?\u201d\n\nMrs. Fisher paused before replying. Was this a habit, this trick of answering a simple question with the same question? If so it must be curbed, for no one could live for four weeks in any real comfort with somebody who had a habit.\n\nShe glanced at Mrs. Arbuthnot, and her parted hair and gentle brow reassured her. No; it was accident, not habit, that had produced those echoes. She could as soon imagine a dove having tiresome habits as Mrs. Arbuthnot. Considering her, she thought what a splendid wife she would have been for poor Carlyle. So much better than that horrid clever Jane. She would have soothed him.\n\n\u201cThen shall we go?\u201d she suggested.\n\n\u201cLet me help you up,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot, all consideration.\n\n\u201cOh, thank you\u2014I can manage perfectly. It\u2019s only sometimes that my stick prevents me\u2014\u201d\n\nMrs. Fisher got up quite easily; Mrs. Arbuthnot had hovered over her for nothing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have one of these gorgeous oranges,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, staying where she was and reaching across to a black bowl piled with them. \u201cRose, how can you resist them. Look\u2014have this one. Do have this beauty\u2014\u201d And she held out a big one.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to see to my duties,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot, moving towards the door. \u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me for leaving you, won\u2019t you,\u201d she added politely to Mrs. Fisher.\n\nMrs. Fisher moved towards the door too; quite easily; almost quickly; her stick did not hinder her at all. She had no intention of being left with Mrs. Wilkins.\n\n\u201cWhat time would you like to have lunch?\u201d Mrs. Arbuthnot asked her, trying to keep her head as at least a non-guest, if not precisely a hostess, above water.\n\n\u201cLunch,\u201d said Mrs. Fisher, \u201cis at half-past twelve.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shall have it at half-past twelve then,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot. \u201cI\u2019ll tell the cook. It will be a great struggle,\u201d she continued, smiling, \u201cbut I\u2019ve brought a little dictionary\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cook,\u201d said Mrs. Fisher, \u201cknows.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\u201cLady Caroline has already told her,\u201d said Mrs. Fisher.\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot again.\n\n\u201cYes. Lady Caroline speaks the kind of Italian cooks understand. I am prevented going into the kitchen because of my stick. And even if I were able to go, I fear I shouldn\u2019t be understood.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d began Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s too wonderful,\u201d Mrs. Wilkins finished for her from the table, delighted with these unexpected simplifications in her and Rose\u2019s lives. \u201cWhy, we\u2019ve got positively nothing to do here, either of us, except just be happy. You wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d she said, turning her head and speaking straight to Mrs. Fisher, portions of orange in either hand, \u201chow terribly good Rose and I have been for years without stopping, and how much now we need a perfect rest.\u201d\n\nAnd Mrs. Fisher, going without answering her out of the room, said to herself, \u201cShe must, she shall be curbed.\u201d\nChapter 8\n\nPresently, when Mrs. Wilkins and Mrs. Arbuthnot, unhampered by any duties, wandered out and down the worn stone steps and under the pergola into the lower garden, Mrs. Wilkins said to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who seemed pensive, \u201cDon\u2019t you see that if somebody else does the ordering it frees us?\u201d\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot said she did see, but nevertheless she thought it rather silly to have everything taken out of their hands.\n\n\u201cI love things to be taken out of my hands,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins.\n\n\u201cBut we found San Salvatore,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot, \u201cand it is rather silly that Mrs. Fisher should behave as if it belonged only to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is rather silly,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins with much serenity, \u201cis to mind. I can\u2019t see the least point in being in authority at the price of one\u2019s liberty.\u201d\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot said nothing to that for two reasons\u2014first, because she was struck by the remarkable and growing calm of the hitherto incoherent and excited Lotty, and secondly because what she was looking at was so very beautiful.\n\nAll down the stone steps on either side were periwinkles in full flower, and she could now see what it was that had caught at her the night before and brushed, wet and scented, across her face. It was wistaria. Wistaria and sunshine . . . she remembered the advertisement. Here indeed were both in profusion. The wistaria was tumbling over itself in its excess of life, its prodigality of flowering; and where the pergola ended the sun blazed on scarlet geraniums, bushes of them, and nasturtiums in great heaps, and marigolds so brilliant that they seemed to be burning, and red and pink snapdragons, all outdoing each other in bright, fierce colour. The ground behind these flaming things dropped away in terraces to the sea, each terrace a little orchard, where among the olives grew vines on trellises, and fig-trees, and peach-trees, and cherry-trees. The cherry-trees and peach-trees were in blossom\u2014lovely showers of white and deep rose-colour among the trembling delicacy of the olives; the fig-leaves were just big enough to smell of figs, the vine-buds were only beginning to show. And beneath these trees were groups of blue and purple irises, and bushes of lavender, and grey, sharp cactuses, and the grass was thick with dandelions and daisies, and right down at the bottom was the sea. Colour seemed flung down anyhow, anywhere; every sort of colour, piled up in heaps, pouring along in rivers\u2014the periwinkles looked exactly as if they were being poured down each side of the steps\u2014and flowers that grow only in borders in England, proud flowers keeping themselves to themselves over there, such as the great blue irises and the lavender, were being jostled by small, shining common things like dandelions and daisies and the white bells of the wild onion, and only seemed the better and the more exuberant for it.\n\nThey stood looking at this crowd of loveliness, this happy jumble, in silence. No, it didn\u2019t matter what Mrs. Fisher did; not here; not in such beauty. Mrs. Arbuthnot\u2019s discomposure melted out of her. In the warmth and light of what she was looking at, of what to her was a manifestation, an entirely new side of God, how could one be discomposed? If only Frederick were with her, seeing it too, seeing as he would have seen it when first they were lovers, in the days when he saw what she saw and loved what she loved. . .\n\nShe sighed.\n\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t sigh in heaven,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins. \u201cOne doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was thinking how one longs to share this with those one loves,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t long in heaven,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be quite complete there. And it is heaven, isn\u2019t it, Rose? See how everything has been let in together\u2014the dandelions and the irises, the vulgar and the superior, me and Mrs. Fisher\u2014all welcome, all mixed up anyhow, and all so visibly happy and enjoying ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Fisher doesn\u2019t seem happy\u2014not visibly, anyhow,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot, smiling.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll begin soon, you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nMrs. Arbuthnot said she didn\u2019t believe that after a certain age people began anything.\n\nMrs. Wilkins said she was sure no one, however old and tough, could resist the effects of perfect beauty. Before many days, perhaps only hours, they would see Mrs. Fisher bursting out into every kind of exuberance. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins, \u201cthat we\u2019ve got to heaven, and once Mrs. Fisher realises that that\u2019s where she is, she\u2019s bound to be different. You\u2019ll see. She\u2019ll leave off being ossified, and go all soft and able to stretch, and we shall get quite\u2014why, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised if we get quite fond of her.\u201d\n\nThe idea of Mrs. Fisher bursting out into anything, she who seemed so particularly firmly fixed inside her buttons, made Mrs. Arbuthnot laugh. She condoned Lotty\u2019s loose way of talking of heaven, because in such a place, on such a morning, condonation was in the very air. Besides, what an excuse there was.\n\nAnd Lady Caroline, sitting where they had left her before breakfast on the wall, peeped over when she heard laughter, and saw them standing on the path below, and thought what a mercy it was they were laughing down there and had not come up and done it round her. She disliked jokes at all times, but in the morning she hated them; especially close up; especially crowding in her ears. She hoped the originals were on their way out for a walk, and not on their way back from one. They were laughing more and more. What could they possibly find to laugh at?\n\nShe looked down on the tops of their heads with a very serious face, for the thought of spending a month with laughers was a grave one, and they, as though they felt her eyes, turned suddenly and looked up.\n\nThe dreadful geniality of those women. . .\n\nShe shrank away from their smiles and wavings, but she could not shrink out of sight without falling into the lilies. She neither smiled nor waved back, and turning her eyes to the more distant mountains surveyed them carefully till the two, tired of waving, moved away along the path and turned the corner and disappeared.\n\nThis time they both did notice that they had been met with, at least, unresponsiveness.\n\n\u201cIf we weren\u2019t in heaven,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins serenely, \u201cI should say we had been snubbed, but as nobody snubs anybody there of course we can\u2019t have been.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps she is unhappy,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\u201cWhatever it is she is she\u2019ll get over it here,\u201d said Mrs. Wilkins with conviction.\n\n\u201cWe must try and help her,\u201d said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\u201cOh, but nobody helps anybody in heaven. That\u2019s finished with. You don\u2019t try to be, or do. You simply are.\u201d\n\nWell, Mrs. Arbuthnot wouldn\u2019t go into that\u2014not here, not to-day. The vicar, she knew, would have called Lotty\u2019s talk levity, if not profanity. How old he seemed from here; an old, old vicar.\n\nThey left the path, and clambered down the olive terraces, down and down, to where at the bottom the warm, sleepy sea heaved gently among the rocks. There a pine-tree grew close to the water, and they sat under it, and a few yards away was a fishing-boat lying motionless and green-bellied on the water. The ripples of the sea made little gurgling noises at their feet. They screwed up their eyes to be able to look into the blaze of light beyond the shade of their tree. The hot smell from the pine-needles and from the cushions of wild thyme that padded the spaces between the rocks, and sometimes a smell of pure honey from a clump of warm irises up behind them in the sun, puffed across their faces. Very soon Mrs. Wilkins took her shoes and stockings off, and let her feet hang in the water. After watching her a minute Mrs. Arbuthnot did the same. Their happiness was then complete. Their husbands would not have known them. They left off talking. They ceased to mention heaven. They were just cups of acceptance.\n\nMeanwhile Lady Caroline, on her wall, was considering her position. The garden on the top of the wall was a delicious garden, but its situation made it insecure and exposed to interruptions. At any moment the others might come and want to use it, because both the hall and the dining-room had doors opening straight into it. Perhaps, thought Lady Caroline, she could arrange that it should be solely hers. Mrs. Fisher had the battlements, delightful with flowers, and a watch-tower all to herself, besides having snatched the one really nice room in the house. There were plenty of places the originals could go to\u2014she had herself seen at least two other little gardens, while the hill the castle stood on was itself a garden, with walks and seats. Why should not this one spot be kept exclusively for her? She liked it; she liked it best of all. It had the Judas tree and an umbrella pine, it had the freesias and the lilies, it had a tamarisk beginning to flush pink, it had the convenient low wall to sit on, it had from each of its three sides the most amazing views\u2014to the east the bay and mountains, to the north the village across the tranquil clear green water of the little harbour and the hills dotted with white houses and orange groves, and to the west was the thin thread of land by which San Salvatore was tied to the mainland, and then the open sea and the coast line beyond Genoa reaching away into the blue dimness of France. Yes, she would say she wanted to have this entirely to herself. How obviously sensible if each of them had their own special place to sit in apart. It was essential to her comfort that she should be able to be apart, left alone, not talked to. The others ought to like it best too. Why herd? One had enough of that in England, with one\u2019s relations and friends\u2014oh, the numbers of them!\u2014pressing on one continually. Having successfully escaped them for four weeks why continue, and with persons having no earthly claim on one, to herd?\n\nShe lit a cigarette. She began to feel secure. Those two had gone for a walk. There was no sign of Mrs. Fisher. How very pleasant this was.\n\nSomebody came out through the glass doors, just as she was drawing a deep breath of security. Surely it couldn\u2019t be Mrs. Fisher, wanting to sit with her? Mrs. Fisher had her battlements. She ought to stay on them, having snatched them. It would be too tiresome if she wouldn\u2019t, and wanted not only to have them and her sitting-room but to establish herself in this garden as well.\n\nNo; it wasn\u2019t Mrs. Fisher, it was the cook.\n\nShe frowned. Was she going to have to go on ordering the food? Surely one or other of those two waving women would do that now.\n\nThe cook, who had been waiting in increasing agitation in the kitchen, watching the clock getting nearer to lunch-time while she still was without knowledge of what lunch was to consist of, had gone at last to Mrs. Fisher, who had immediately waved her away. She then wandered about the house seeking a mistress, any mistress, who would tell her what to cook, and finding none; and at last, directed by Francesca, who always knew where everybody was, came out to Lady Caroline.\n\nDomenico had provided this cook. She was Costanza, the sister of that one of his cousins who kept a restaurant down on the piazza. She helped her brother in his cooking when she had no other job, and knew every sort of fat, mysterious Italian dish such as the workmen of Castagneto, who crowded the restaurant at midday, and the inhabitants of Mezzago when they came over on Sundays, loved to eat. She was a fleshless spinster of fifty, grey-haired, nimble, rich of speech, and thought Lady Caroline more beautiful than anyone she had ever seen; and so did Domenico; and so did the boy Giuseppe who helped Domenico and was, besides, his nephew; and so did the girl Angela who helped Francesca and was, besides, Domenico\u2019s niece; and so did Francesca herself. Domenico and Francesca, the only two who had seen them, thought the two ladies who arrived last very beautiful, but compared to the fair young lady who arrived first they were as candles to the electric light that had lately been installed, and as the tin tubs in the bedrooms to the wonderful new bathroom their master had had arranged on his last visit.\n\nLady Caroline scowled at the cook. The scowl, as usual, was transformed on the way into what appeared to be an intent and beautiful gravity, and Costanza threw up her hands and took the saints aloud to witness that here was the very picture of the Mother of God.\n\nLady Caroline asked her crossly what she wanted, and Costanza\u2019s head went on one side with delight at the sheer music of her voice. She said, after waiting a moment in case the music was going to continue, for she didn\u2019t wish to miss any of it, that she wanted orders; she had been to the Signorina\u2019s mother, but in vain.\n\n\u201cShe is not my mother,\u201d repudiated Lady Caroline angrily; and her anger sounded like the regretful wail of a melodious orphan.\n\nCostanza poured forth pity. She too, she explained, had no mother\u2014\n\nLady Caroline interrupted with the curt information that her mother was alive and in London.\n\nCostanza praised God and the saints that the young lady did not yet know what it was like to be without a mother. Quickly enough did misfortunes overtake one; no doubt the young lady already had a husband.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Lady Caroline icily. Worse than jokes in the morning did she hate the idea of husbands. And everybody was always trying to press them on her\u2014all her relations, all her friends, all the evening papers. After all, she could only marry one, anyhow; but you would think from the way everybody talked, and especially those persons who wanted to be husbands, that she could marry at least a dozen.\n\nHer soft, pathetic \u201cNo\u201d made Costanza, who was standing close to her, well with sympathy.\n\n\u201cPoor little one,\u201d said Costanza, moved actually to pat her encouragingly on the shoulder, \u201ctake hope. There is still time.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor lunch,\u201d said Lady Caroline freezingly, marvelling as she spoke that she should be patted, she who had taken so much trouble to come to a place, remote and hidden, where she could be sure that among other things of a like oppressive nature pattings also were not, \u201cwe will have\u2014\u201d\n\nCostanza became business-like. She interrupted with suggestions, and her suggestions were all admirable and all expensive.\n\nLady Caroline did not know they were expensive, and fell in with them at once. They sounded very nice. Every sort of young vegetables and fruits came into them, and much butter and a great deal of cream and incredible numbers of eggs. Costanza said enthusiastically at the end, as a tribute to this acquiescence, that of the many ladies and gentlemen she had worked for on temporary jobs such as this she preferred the English ladies and gentlemen. She more than preferred them\u2014they roused devotion in her. For they knew what to order; they did not skimp; they refrained from grinding down the faces of the poor.\n\nFrom this Lady Caroline concluded that she had been extravagant, and promptly countermanded the cream.\n\nCostanza\u2019s face fell, for she had a cousin who had a cow, and the cream was to have come from them both.\n\n\u201cAnd perhaps we had better not have chickens,\u201d said Lady Caroline.\n\nCostanza\u2019s face fell more, for her brother at the restaurant kept chickens in his back-yard, and many of them were ready for killing.\n\n\u201cAlso do not order strawberries till I have consulted with the other ladies,\u201d said Lady Caroline, remembering that it was only the first of April, and that perhaps people who lived in Hampstead might be poor; indeed, must be poor, or why live in Hampstead? \u201cIt is not I who am mistress here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it the old one?\u201d asked Costanza, her face very long.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Lady Caroline.\n\n\u201cWhich of the other two ladies is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither,\u201d said Lady Caroline.\n\nThen Costanza\u2019s smiles returned, for the young lady was having fun with her and making jokes. She told her so, in her friendly Italian way, and was genuinely delighted.\n\n\u201cI never make jokes,\u201d said Lady Caroline briefly. \u201cYou had better go, or lunch will certainly not be ready by half-past twelve.\u201d\n\nAnd these curt words came out sounding so sweet that Costanza felt as if kind compliments were being paid her, and forgot her disappointment about the cream and the chickens, and went away all gratitude and smiles.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d thought Lady Caroline, \u201cwill never do. I haven\u2019t come here to housekeep, and I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe called Costanza back. Costanza came running. The sound of her name in that voice enchanted her.\n\n\u201cI have ordered the lunch for to-day,\u201d said Lady Caroline, with the serious angel face that was hers when she was annoyed, \u201cand I have also ordered the dinner, but from now on you will go to one of the other ladies for orders. I give no more.\u201d\n\nThe idea that she would go on giving orders was too absurd. She never gave orders at home. Nobody there dreamed of asking her to do anything. That such a very tiresome activity should be thrust upon her here, simply because she happened to be able to talk Italian, was ridiculous. Let the originals give orders if Mrs. Fisher refused to. Mrs. Fisher, of course, was the one Nature intended for such a purpose. She had the very air of a competent housekeeper. Her clothes were the clothes of a housekeeper, and so was the way she did her hair.\n\nHaving delivered herself of her ultimatum with an acerbity that turned sweet on the way, and accompanied it by a peremptory gesture of dismissal that had the grace and loving-kindness of a benediction, it was annoying that Costanza should only stand still with her head on one side gazing at her in obvious delight.\n\n\u201cOh, go away!\u201d exclaimed Lady Caroline in English, suddenly exasperated.\n\nThere had been a fly in her bedroom that morning which had stuck just as Costanza was sticking; only one, but it might have been a myriad it was so tiresome from daylight on. It was determined to settle on her face, and she was determined it should not. Its persistence was uncanny. It woke her, and would not let her go to sleep again. She hit at it, and it eluded her without fuss or effort and with an almost visible blandness, and she had only hit herself. It came back again instantly, and with a loud buzz alighted on her cheek. She hit at it again and hurt herself, while it skimmed gracefully away. She lost her temper, and sat up in bed and waited, watching to hit at it and kill it. She kept on hitting at it at last with fury and with all her strength, as if it were a real enemy deliberately trying to madden her; and it elegantly skimmed in and out of her blows, not even angry, to be back again the next instant. It succeeded every time in getting on to her face, and was quite indifferent how often it was driven away. That was why she had dressed and come out so early. Francesca had already been told to put a net over her bed, for she was not going to allow herself to be annoyed twice like that. People were exactly like flies. She wished there were nets for keeping them off too. She hit at them with words and frowns, and like the fly they slipped between her blows and were untouched. Worse than the fly, they seemed unaware that she had even tried to hit them. The fly at least did for a moment go away. With human beings the only way to get rid of them was to go away herself. That was what, so tired, she had done this April; and having got here, having got close up to the details of life at San Salvatore, it appeared that here, too, she was not to be let alone.\n\nViewed from London there had seemed to be no details. San Salvatore from there seemed to be an empty, a delicious blank. Yet, after only twenty-four hours of it, she was discovering that it was not a blank at all, and that she was having to ward off as actively as ever. Already she had been much stuck to. Mrs. Fisher had stuck nearly the whole of the day before, and this morning there had been no peace, not ten minutes uninterruptedly alone.\n\nCostanza of course had finally to go because she had to cook, but hardly had she gone before Domenico came. He came to water and tie up. That was natural, since he was the gardener, but he watered and tied up all the things that were nearest to her; he hovered closer and closer; he watered to excess; he tied plants that were as straight and steady as arrows. Well, at least he was a man, and therefore not quite so annoying, and his smiling good-morning was received with an answering smile; upon which Domenico forgot his family, his wife, his mother, his grown-up children and all his duties, and only wanted to kiss the young lady\u2019s feet.\n\nHe could not do that, unfortunately, but he could talk while he worked, and talk he did; voluminously; pouring out every kind of information, illustrating what he said with gestures so lively that he had to put down the watering-pot, and thus delay the end of the watering.\n\nLady Caroline bore it for a time but presently was unable to bear it, and as he would not go, and she could not tell him to, seeing that he was engaged in his proper work, once again it was she who had to.\n\nShe got off the wall and moved to the other side of the garden, where in a wooden shed were some comfortable low cane chairs. All she wanted was to turn one of these round with its back to Domenico and its front to the sea towards Genoa. Such a little thing to want. One would have thought she might have been allowed to do that unmolested. But he, who watched her every movement, when he saw her approaching the chairs darted after her and seized one and asked to be told where to put it.\n\nWould she never get away from being waited on, being made comfortable, being asked where she wanted things put, having to say thank you? She was short with Domenico, who instantly concluded the sun had given her a headache, and ran in and fetched her a sunshade and a cushion and a footstool, and was skilful, and was wonderful, and was one of Nature\u2019s gentlemen.\n"},{title:"The King in Yellow",author:"Robert W. Chambers",gender:"Male",text:'Toward the end of the year 1920 the Government of the United States had practically completed the programme, adopted during the last months of President Winthrop\'s administration. The country was apparently tranquil. Everybody knows how the Tariff and Labour questions were settled. The war with Germany, incident on that country\'s seizure of the Samoan Islands, had left no visible scars upon the republic, and the temporary occupation of Norfolk by the invading army had been forgotten in the joy over repeated naval victories, and the subsequent ridiculous plight of General Von Gartenlaube\'s forces in the State of New Jersey. The Cuban and Hawaiian investments had paid one hundred per cent and the territory of Samoa was well worth its cost as a coaling station. The country was in a superb state of defence. Every coast city had been well supplied with land fortifications; the army under the parental eye of the General Staff, organized according to the Prussian system, had been increased to 300,000 men, with a territorial reserve of a million; and six magnificent squadrons of cruisers and battle-ships patrolled the six stations of the navigable seas, leaving a steam reserve amply fitted to control home waters. The gentlemen from the West had at last been constrained to acknowledge that a college for the training of diplomats was as necessary as law schools are for the training of barristers; consequently we were no longer represented abroad by incompetent patriots. The nation was prosperous; Chicago, for a moment paralyzed after a second great fire, had risen from its ruins, white and imperial, and more beautiful than the white city which had been built for its plaything in 1893. Everywhere good architecture was replacing bad, and even in New York, a sudden craving for decency had swept away a great portion of the existing horrors. Streets had been widened, properly paved and lighted, trees had been planted, squares laid out, elevated structures demolished and underground roads built to replace them. The new government buildings and barracks were fine bits of architecture, and the long system of stone quays which completely surrounded the island had been turned into parks which proved a god-send to the population. The subsidizing of the state theatre and state opera brought its own reward. The United States National Academy of Design was much like European institutions of the same kind. Nobody envied the Secretary of Fine Arts, either his cabinet position or his portfolio. The Secretary of Forestry and Game Preservation had a much easier time, thanks to the new system of National Mounted Police. We had profited well by the latest treaties with France and England; the exclusion of foreign-born Jews as a measure of self-preservation, the settlement of the new independent negro state of Suanee, the checking of immigration, the new laws concerning naturalization, and the gradual centralization of power in the executive all contributed to national calm and prosperity. When the Government solved the Indian problem and squadrons of Indian cavalry scouts in native costume were substituted for the pitiable organizations tacked on to the tail of skeletonized regiments by a former Secretary of War, the nation drew a long sigh of relief. When, after the colossal Congress of Religions, bigotry and intolerance were laid in their graves and kindness and charity began to draw warring sects together, many thought the millennium had arrived, at least in the new world which after all is a world by itself.\n\nBut self-preservation is the first law, and the United States had to look on in helpless sorrow as Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium writhed in the throes of Anarchy, while Russia, watching from the Caucasus, stooped and bound them one by one.\n\nIn the city of New York the summer of 1899 was signalized by the dismantling of the Elevated Railroads. The summer of 1900 will live in the memories of New York people for many a cycle; the Dodge Statue was removed in that year. In the following winter began that agitation for the repeal of the laws prohibiting suicide which bore its final fruit in the month of April, 1920, when the first Government Lethal Chamber was opened on Washington Square.\n\nI had walked down that day from Dr. Archer\'s house on Madison Avenue, where I had been as a mere formality. Ever since that fall from my horse, four years before, I had been troubled at times with pains in the back of my head and neck, but now for months they had been absent, and the doctor sent me away that day saying there was nothing more to be cured in me. It was hardly worth his fee to be told that; I knew it myself. Still I did not grudge him the money. What I minded was the mistake which he made at first. When they picked me up from the pavement where I lay unconscious, and somebody had mercifully sent a bullet through my horse\'s head, I was carried to Dr. Archer, and he, pronouncing my brain affected, placed me in his private asylum where I was obliged to endure treatment for insanity. At last he decided that I was well, and I, knowing that my mind had always been as sound as his, if not sounder, "paid my tuition" as he jokingly called it, and left. I told him, smiling, that I would get even with him for his mistake, and he laughed heartily, and asked me to call once in a while. I did so, hoping for a chance to even up accounts, but he gave me none, and I told him I would wait.\n\nThe fall from my horse had fortunately left no evil results; on the contrary it had changed my whole character for the better. From a lazy young man about town, I had become active, energetic, temperate, and above all\u2014oh, above all else\u2014ambitious. There was only one thing which troubled me, I laughed at my own uneasiness, and yet it troubled me.\n\nDuring my convalescence I had bought and read for the first time, The King in Yellow. I remember after finishing the first act that it occurred to me that I had better stop. I started up and flung the book into the fireplace; the volume struck the barred grate and fell open on the hearth in the firelight. If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it, but as I stooped to pick it up, my eyes became riveted to the open page, and with a cry of terror, or perhaps it was of joy so poignant that I suffered in every nerve, I snatched the thing out of the coals and crept shaking to my bedroom, where I read it and reread it, and wept and laughed and trembled with a horror which at times assails me yet. This is the thing that troubles me, for I cannot forget Carcosa where black stars hang in the heavens; where the shadows of men\'s thoughts lengthen in the afternoon, when the twin suns sink into the lake of Hali; and my mind will bear for ever the memory of the Pallid Mask. I pray God will curse the writer, as the writer has cursed the world with this beautiful, stupendous creation, terrible in its simplicity, irresistible in its truth\u2014a world which now trembles before the King in Yellow. When the French Government seized the translated copies which had just arrived in Paris, London, of course, became eager to read it. It is well known how the book spread like an infectious disease, from city to city, from continent to continent, barred out here, confiscated there, denounced by Press and pulpit, censured even by the most advanced of literary anarchists. No definite principles had been violated in those wicked pages, no doctrine promulgated, no convictions outraged. It could not be judged by any known standard, yet, although it was acknowledged that the supreme note of art had been struck in The King in Yellow, all felt that human nature could not bear the strain, nor thrive on words in which the essence of purest poison lurked. The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect.\n\nIt was, I remember, the 13th day of April, 1920, that the first Government Lethal Chamber was established on the south side of Washington Square, between Wooster Street and South Fifth Avenue. The block which had formerly consisted of a lot of shabby old buildings, used as caf\xe9s and restaurants for foreigners, had been acquired by the Government in the winter of 1898. The French and Italian caf\xe9s and restaurants were torn down; the whole block was enclosed by a gilded iron railing, and converted into a lovely garden with lawns, flowers and fountains. In the centre of the garden stood a small, white building, severely classical in architecture, and surrounded by thickets of flowers. Six Ionic columns supported the roof, and the single door was of bronze. A splendid marble group of the "Fates" stood before the door, the work of a young American sculptor, Boris Yvain, who had died in Paris when only twenty-three years old.\n\nThe inauguration ceremonies were in progress as I crossed University Place and entered the square. I threaded my way through the silent throng of spectators, but was stopped at Fourth Street by a cordon of police. A regiment of United States lancers were drawn up in a hollow square round the Lethal Chamber. On a raised tribune facing Washington Park stood the Governor of New York, and behind him were grouped the Mayor of New York and Brooklyn, the Inspector-General of Police, the Commandant of the state troops, Colonel Livingston, military aid to the President of the United States, General Blount, commanding at Governor\'s Island, Major-General Hamilton, commanding the garrison of New York and Brooklyn, Admiral Buffby of the fleet in the North River, Surgeon-General Lanceford, the staff of the National Free Hospital, Senators Wyse and Franklin of New York, and the Commissioner of Public Works. The tribune was surrounded by a squadron of hussars of the National Guard.\n\nThe Governor was finishing his reply to the short speech of the Surgeon-General. I heard him say: "The laws prohibiting suicide and providing punishment for any attempt at self-destruction have been repealed. The Government has seen fit to acknowledge the right of man to end an existence which may have become intolerable to him, through physical suffering or mental despair. It is believed that the community will be benefited by the removal of such people from their midst. Since the passage of this law, the number of suicides in the United States has not increased. Now the Government has determined to establish a Lethal Chamber in every city, town and village in the country, it remains to be seen whether or not that class of human creatures from whose desponding ranks new victims of self-destruction fall daily will accept the relief thus provided." He paused, and turned to the white Lethal Chamber. The silence in the street was absolute. "There a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life. If death is welcome let him seek it there." Then quickly turning to the military aid of the President\'s household, he said, "I declare the Lethal Chamber open," and again facing the vast crowd he cried in a clear voice: "Citizens of New York and of the United States of America, through me the Government declares the Lethal Chamber to be open."\n\nThe solemn hush was broken by a sharp cry of command, the squadron of hussars filed after the Governor\'s carriage, the lancers wheeled and formed along Fifth Avenue to wait for the commandant of the garrison, and the mounted police followed them. I left the crowd to gape and stare at the white marble Death Chamber, and, crossing South Fifth Avenue, walked along the western side of that thoroughfare to Bleecker Street. Then I turned to the right and stopped before a dingy shop which bore the sign:\n\nHAWBERK, ARMOURER.\n\nI glanced in at the doorway and saw Hawberk busy in his little shop at the end of the hall. He looked up, and catching sight of me cried in his deep, hearty voice, "Come in, Mr. Castaigne!" Constance, his daughter, rose to meet me as I crossed the threshold, and held out her pretty hand, but I saw the blush of disappointment on her cheeks, and knew that it was another Castaigne she had expected, my cousin Louis. I smiled at her confusion and complimented her on the banner she was embroidering from a coloured plate. Old Hawberk sat riveting the worn greaves of some ancient suit of armour, and the ting! ting! ting! of his little hammer sounded pleasantly in the quaint shop. Presently he dropped his hammer, and fussed about for a moment with a tiny wrench. The soft clash of the mail sent a thrill of pleasure through me. I loved to hear the music of steel brushing against steel, the mellow shock of the mallet on thigh pieces, and the jingle of chain armour. That was the only reason I went to see Hawberk. He had never interested me personally, nor did Constance, except for the fact of her being in love with Louis. This did occupy my attention, and sometimes even kept me awake at night. But I knew in my heart that all would come right, and that I should arrange their future as I expected to arrange that of my kind doctor, John Archer. However, I should never have troubled myself about visiting them just then, had it not been, as I say, that the music of the tinkling hammer had for me this strong fascination. I would sit for hours, listening and listening, and when a stray sunbeam struck the inlaid steel, the sensation it gave me was almost too keen to endure. My eyes would become fixed, dilating with a pleasure that stretched every nerve almost to breaking, until some movement of the old armourer cut off the ray of sunlight, then, still thrilling secretly, I leaned back and listened again to the sound of the polishing rag, swish! swish! rubbing rust from the rivets.\n\nConstance worked with the embroidery over her knees, now and then pausing to examine more closely the pattern in the coloured plate from the Metropolitan Museum.\n\n"Who is this for?" I asked.\n\nHawberk explained, that in addition to the treasures of armour in the Metropolitan Museum of which he had been appointed armourer, he also had charge of several collections belonging to rich amateurs. This was the missing greave of a famous suit which a client of his had traced to a little shop in Paris on the Quai d\'Orsay. He, Hawberk, had negotiated for and secured the greave, and now the suit was complete. He laid down his hammer and read me the history of the suit, traced since 1450 from owner to owner until it was acquired by Thomas Stainbridge. When his superb collection was sold, this client of Hawberk\'s bought the suit, and since then the search for the missing greave had been pushed until it was, almost by accident, located in Paris.\n\n"Did you continue the search so persistently without any certainty of the greave being still in existence?" I demanded.\n\n"Of course," he replied coolly.\n\nThen for the first time I took a personal interest in Hawberk.\n\n"It was worth something to you," I ventured.\n\n"No," he replied, laughing, "my pleasure in finding it was my reward."\n\n"Have you no ambition to be rich?" I asked, smiling.\n\n"My one ambition is to be the best armourer in the world," he answered gravely.\n\nConstance asked me if I had seen the ceremonies at the Lethal Chamber. She herself had noticed cavalry passing up Broadway that morning, and had wished to see the inauguration, but her father wanted the banner finished, and she had stayed at his request.\n\n"Did you see your cousin, Mr. Castaigne, there?" she asked, with the slightest tremor of her soft eyelashes.\n\n"No," I replied carelessly. "Louis\' regiment is man\u0153uvring out in Westchester County." I rose and picked up my hat and cane.\n\n"Are you going upstairs to see the lunatic again?" laughed old Hawberk. If Hawberk knew how I loathe that word "lunatic," he would never use it in my presence. It rouses certain feelings within me which I do not care to explain. However, I answered him quietly: "I think I shall drop in and see Mr. Wilde for a moment or two."\n\n"Poor fellow," said Constance, with a shake of the head, "it must be hard to live alone year after year poor, crippled and almost demented. It is very good of you, Mr. Castaigne, to visit him as often as you do."\n\n"I think he is vicious," observed Hawberk, beginning again with his hammer. I listened to the golden tinkle on the greave plates; when he had finished I replied:\n\n"No, he is not vicious, nor is he in the least demented. His mind is a wonder chamber, from which he can extract treasures that you and I would give years of our life to acquire."\'\n\nHawberk laughed.\n\nI continued a little impatiently: "He knows history as no one else could know it. Nothing, however trivial, escapes his search, and his memory is so absolute, so precise in details, that were it known in New York that such a man existed, the people could not honour him enough."\n\n"Nonsense," muttered Hawberk, searching on the floor for a fallen rivet.\n\n"Is it nonsense," I asked, managing to suppress what I felt, "is it nonsense when he says that the tassets and cuissards of the enamelled suit of armour commonly known as the \'Prince\'s Emblazoned\' can be found among a mass of rusty theatrical properties, broken stoves and ragpicker\'s refuse in a garret in Pell Street?"\n\nHawberk\'s hammer fell to the ground, but he picked it up and asked, with a great deal of calm, how I knew that the tassets and left cuissard were missing from the "Prince\'s Emblazoned."\n\n"I did not know until Mr. Wilde mentioned it to me the other day. He said they were in the garret of 998 Pell Street."\n\n"Nonsense," he cried, but I noticed his hand trembling under his leathern apron.\n\n"Is this nonsense too?" I asked pleasantly, "is it nonsense when Mr. Wilde continually speaks of you as the Marquis of Avonshire and of Miss Constance\u2014"\n\nI did not finish, for Constance had started to her feet with terror written on every feature. Hawberk looked at me and slowly smoothed his leathern apron.\n\n"That is impossible," he observed, "Mr. Wilde may know a great many things\u2014"\n\n"About armour, for instance, and the \'Prince\'s Emblazoned,\'" I interposed, smiling.\n\n"Yes," he continued, slowly, "about armour also\u2014may be\u2014but he is wrong in regard to the Marquis of Avonshire, who, as you know, killed his wife\'s traducer years ago, and went to Australia where he did not long survive his wife."\n\n"Mr. Wilde is wrong," murmured Constance. Her lips were blanched, but her voice was sweet and calm.\n\n"Let us agree, if you please, that in this one circumstance Mr. Wilde is wrong," I said.\nII\n\nI climbed the three dilapidated flights of stairs, which I had so often climbed before, and knocked at a small door at the end of the corridor. Mr. Wilde opened the door and I walked in.\n\nWhen he had double-locked the door and pushed a heavy chest against it, he came and sat down beside me, peering up into my face with his little light-coloured eyes. Half a dozen new scratches covered his nose and cheeks, and the silver wires which supported his artificial ears had become displaced. I thought I had never seen him so hideously fascinating. He had no ears. The artificial ones, which now stood out at an angle from the fine wire, were his one weakness. They were made of wax and painted a shell pink, but the rest of his face was yellow. He might better have revelled in the luxury of some artificial fingers for his left hand, which was absolutely fingerless, but it seemed to cause him no inconvenience, and he was satisfied with his wax ears. He was very small, scarcely higher than a child of ten, but his arms were magnificently developed, and his thighs as thick as any athlete\'s. Still, the most remarkable thing about Mr. Wilde was that a man of his marvellous intelligence and knowledge should have such a head. It was flat and pointed, like the heads of many of those unfortunates whom people imprison in asylums for the weak-minded. Many called him insane, but I knew him to be as sane as I was.\n\nI do not deny that he was eccentric; the mania he had for keeping that cat and teasing her until she flew at his face like a demon, was certainly eccentric. I never could understand why he kept the creature, nor what pleasure he found in shutting himself up in his room with this surly, vicious beast. I remember once, glancing up from the manuscript I was studying by the light of some tallow dips, and seeing Mr. Wilde squatting motionless on his high chair, his eyes fairly blazing with excitement, while the cat, which had risen from her place before the stove, came creeping across the floor right at him. Before I could move she flattened her belly to the ground, crouched, trembled, and sprang into his face. Howling and foaming they rolled over and over on the floor, scratching and clawing, until the cat screamed and fled under the cabinet, and Mr. Wilde turned over on his back, his limbs contracting and curling up like the legs of a dying spider. He was eccentric.\n\nMr. Wilde had climbed into his high chair, and, after studying my face, picked up a dog\'s-eared ledger and opened it.\n\n"Henry B. Matthews," he read, "book-keeper with Whysot Whysot and Company, dealers in church ornaments. Called April 3rd. Reputation damaged on the race-track. Known as a welcher. Reputation to be repaired by August 1st. Retainer Five Dollars." He turned the page and ran his fingerless knuckles down the closely-written columns.\n\n"P. Greene Dusenberry, Minister of the Gospel, Fairbeach, New Jersey. Reputation damaged in the Bowery. To be repaired as soon as possible. Retainer $100."\n\nHe coughed and added, "Called, April 6th."\n\n"Then you are not in need of money, Mr. Wilde," I inquired.\n\n"Listen," he coughed again.\n\n"Mrs. C. Hamilton Chester, of Chester Park, New York City. Called April 7th. Reputation damaged at Dieppe, France. To be repaired by October 1st Retainer $500.\n\n"Note.\u2014C. Hamilton Chester, Captain U.S.S. \'Avalanche\', ordered home from South Sea Squadron October 1st."\n\n"Well," I said, "the profession of a Repairer of Reputations is lucrative."\n\nHis colourless eyes sought mine, "I only wanted to demonstrate that I was correct. You said it was impossible to succeed as a Repairer of Reputations; that even if I did succeed in certain cases it would cost me more than I would gain by it. To-day I have five hundred men in my employ, who are poorly paid, but who pursue the work with an enthusiasm which possibly may be born of fear. These men enter every shade and grade of society; some even are pillars of the most exclusive social temples; others are the prop and pride of the financial world; still others, hold undisputed sway among the \'Fancy and the Talent.\' I choose them at my leisure from those who reply to my advertisements. It is easy enough, they are all cowards. I could treble the number in twenty days if I wished. So you see, those who have in their keeping the reputations of their fellow-citizens, I have in my pay."\n\n"They may turn on you," I suggested.\n\nHe rubbed his thumb over his cropped ears, and adjusted the wax substitutes. "I think not," he murmured thoughtfully, "I seldom have to apply the whip, and then only once. Besides they like their wages."\n\n"How do you apply the whip?" I demanded.\n\nHis face for a moment was awful to look upon. His eyes dwindled to a pair of green sparks.\n\n"I invite them to come and have a little chat with me," he said in a soft voice.\n\nA knock at the door interrupted him, and his face resumed its amiable expression.\n\n"Who is it?" he inquired.\n\n"Mr. Steylette," was the answer.\n\n"Come to-morrow," replied Mr. Wilde.\n\n"Impossible," began the other, but was silenced by a sort of bark from Mr. Wilde.\n\n"Come to-morrow," he repeated.\n\nWe heard somebody move away from the door and turn the corner by the stairway.\n\n"Who is that?" I asked.\n\n"Arnold Steylette, Owner and Editor in Chief of the great New York daily."\n\nHe drummed on the ledger with his fingerless hand adding: "I pay him very badly, but he thinks it a good bargain."\n\n"Arnold Steylette!" I repeated amazed.\n\n"Yes," said Mr. Wilde, with a self-satisfied cough.\n\nThe cat, which had entered the room as he spoke, hesitated, looked up at him and snarled. He climbed down from the chair and squatting on the floor, took the creature into his arms and caressed her. The cat ceased snarling and presently began a loud purring which seemed to increase in timbre as he stroked her. "Where are the notes?" I asked. He pointed to the table, and for the hundredth time I picked up the bundle of manuscript entitled\u2014\n\n"THE IMPERIAL DYNASTY OF AMERICA."\n\nOne by one I studied the well-worn pages, worn only by my own handling, and although I knew all by heart, from the beginning, "When from Carcosa, the Hyades, Hastur, and Aldebaran," to "Castaigne, Louis de Calvados, born December 19th, 1877," I read it with an eager, rapt attention, pausing to repeat parts of it aloud, and dwelling especially on "Hildred de Calvados, only son of Hildred Castaigne and Edythe Landes Castaigne, first in succession," etc., etc.\n\nWhen I finished, Mr. Wilde nodded and coughed.\n\n"Speaking of your legitimate ambition," he said, "how do Constance and Louis get along?"\n\n"She loves him," I replied simply.\n\nThe cat on his knee suddenly turned and struck at his eyes, and he flung her off and climbed on to the chair opposite me.\n\n"And Dr. Archer! But that\'s a matter you can settle any time you wish," he added.\n\n"Yes," I replied, "Dr. Archer can wait, but it is time I saw my cousin Louis."\n\n"It is time," he repeated. Then he took another ledger from the table and ran over the leaves rapidly. "We are now in communication with ten thousand men," he muttered. "We can count on one hundred thousand within the first twenty-eight hours, and in forty-eight hours the state will rise en masse. The country follows the state, and the portion that will not, I mean California and the Northwest, might better never have been inhabited. I shall not send them the Yellow Sign."\n\nThe blood rushed to my head, but I only answered, "A new broom sweeps clean."\n\n"The ambition of Caesar and of Napoleon pales before that which could not rest until it had seized the minds of men and controlled even their unborn thoughts," said Mr. Wilde.\n\n"You are speaking of the King in Yellow," I groaned, with a shudder.\n\n"He is a king whom emperors have served."\n\n"I am content to serve him," I replied.\n\nMr. Wilde sat rubbing his ears with his crippled hand. "Perhaps Constance does not love him," he suggested.\n\nI started to reply, but a sudden burst of military music from the street below drowned my voice. The twentieth dragoon regiment, formerly in garrison at Mount St. Vincent, was returning from the man\u0153uvres in Westchester County, to its new barracks on East Washington Square. It was my cousin\'s regiment. They were a fine lot of fellows, in their pale blue, tight-fitting jackets, jaunty busbys and white riding breeches with the double yellow stripe, into which their limbs seemed moulded. Every other squadron was armed with lances, from the metal points of which fluttered yellow and white pennons. The band passed, playing the regimental march, then came the colonel and staff, the horses crowding and trampling, while their heads bobbed in unison, and the pennons fluttered from their lance points. The troopers, who rode with the beautiful English seat, looked brown as berries from their bloodless campaign among the farms of Westchester, and the music of their sabres against the stirrups, and the jingle of spurs and carbines was delightful to me. I saw Louis riding with his squadron. He was as handsome an officer as I have ever seen. Mr. Wilde, who had mounted a chair by the window, saw him too, but said nothing. Louis turned and looked straight at Hawberk\'s shop as he passed, and I could see the flush on his brown cheeks. I think Constance must have been at the window. When the last troopers had clattered by, and the last pennons vanished into South Fifth Avenue, Mr. Wilde clambered out of his chair and dragged the chest away from the door.\n\n"Yes," he said, "it is time that you saw your cousin Louis."\n\nHe unlocked the door and I picked up my hat and stick and stepped into the corridor. The stairs were dark. Groping about, I set my foot on something soft, which snarled and spit, and I aimed a murderous blow at the cat, but my cane shivered to splinters against the balustrade, and the beast scurried back into Mr. Wilde\'s room.\n\nPassing Hawberk\'s door again I saw him still at work on the armour, but I did not stop, and stepping out into Bleecker Street, I followed it to Wooster, skirted the grounds of the Lethal Chamber, and crossing Washington Park went straight to my rooms in the Benedick. Here I lunched comfortably, read the Herald and the Meteor, and finally went to the steel safe in my bedroom and set the time combination. The three and three-quarter minutes which it is necessary to wait, while the time lock is opening, are to me golden moments. From the instant I set the combination to the moment when I grasp the knobs and swing back the solid steel doors, I live in an ecstasy of expectation. Those moments must be like moments passed in Paradise. I know what I am to find at the end of the time limit. I know what the massive safe holds secure for me, for me alone, and the exquisite pleasure of waiting is hardly enhanced when the safe opens and I lift, from its velvet crown, a diadem of purest gold, blazing with diamonds. I do this every day, and yet the joy of waiting and at last touching again the diadem, only seems to increase as the days pass. It is a diadem fit for a King among kings, an Emperor among emperors. The King in Yellow might scorn it, but it shall be worn by his royal servant.\n\nI held it in my arms until the alarm in the safe rang harshly, and then tenderly, proudly, I replaced it and shut the steel doors. I walked slowly back into my study, which faces Washington Square, and leaned on the window sill. The afternoon sun poured into my windows, and a gentle breeze stirred the branches of the elms and maples in the park, now covered with buds and tender foliage. A flock of pigeons circled about the tower of the Memorial Church; sometimes alighting on the purple tiled roof, sometimes wheeling downward to the lotos fountain in front of the marble arch. The gardeners were busy with the flower beds around the fountain, and the freshly turned earth smelled sweet and spicy. A lawn mower, drawn by a fat white horse, clinked across the green sward, and watering-carts poured showers of spray over the asphalt drives. Around the statue of Peter Stuyvesant, which in 1897 had replaced the monstrosity supposed to represent Garibaldi, children played in the spring sunshine, and nurse girls wheeled elaborate baby carriages with a reckless disregard for the pasty-faced occupants, which could probably be explained by the presence of half a dozen trim dragoon troopers languidly lolling on the benches. Through the trees, the Washington Memorial Arch glistened like silver in the sunshine, and beyond, on the eastern extremity of the square the grey stone barracks of the dragoons, and the white granite artillery stables were alive with colour and motion.\n\nI looked at the Lethal Chamber on the corner of the square opposite. A few curious people still lingered about the gilded iron railing, but inside the grounds the paths were deserted. I watched the fountains ripple and sparkle; the sparrows had already found this new bathing nook, and the basins were covered with the dusty-feathered little things. Two or three white peacocks picked their way across the lawns, and a drab coloured pigeon sat so motionless on the arm of one of the "Fates," that it seemed to be a part of the sculptured stone.\n\nAs I was turning carelessly away, a slight commotion in the group of curious loiterers around the gates attracted my attention. A young man had entered, and was advancing with nervous strides along the gravel path which leads to the bronze doors of the Lethal Chamber. He paused a moment before the "Fates," and as he raised his head to those three mysterious faces, the pigeon rose from its sculptured perch, circled about for a moment and wheeled to the east. The young man pressed his hand to his face, and then with an undefinable gesture sprang up the marble steps, the bronze doors closed behind him, and half an hour later the loiterers slouched away, and the frightened pigeon returned to its perch in the arms of Fate.\n\nI put on my hat and went out into the park for a little walk before dinner. As I crossed the central driveway a group of officers passed, and one of them called out, "Hello, Hildred," and came back to shake hands with me. It was my cousin Louis, who stood smiling and tapping his spurred heels with his riding-whip.\n\n"Just back from Westchester," he said; "been doing the bucolic; milk and curds, you know, dairy-maids in sunbonnets, who say \'haeow\' and \'I don\'t think\' when you tell them they are pretty. I\'m nearly dead for a square meal at Delmonico\'s. What\'s the news?"\n\n"There is none," I replied pleasantly. "I saw your regiment coming in this morning."\n\n"Did you? I didn\'t see you. Where were you?"\n\n"In Mr. Wilde\'s window."\n\n"Oh, hell!" he began impatiently, "that man is stark mad! I don\'t understand why you\u2014"\n\nHe saw how annoyed I felt by this outburst, and begged my pardon.\n\n"Really, old chap," he said, "I don\'t mean to run down a man you like, but for the life of me I can\'t see what the deuce you find in common with Mr. Wilde. He\'s not well bred, to put it generously; he is hideously deformed; his head is the head of a criminally insane person. You know yourself he\'s been in an asylum\u2014"\n\n"So have I," I interrupted calmly.\n\nLouis looked startled and confused for a moment, but recovered and slapped me heartily on the shoulder. "You were completely cured," he began; but I stopped him again.\n\n"I suppose you mean that I was simply acknowledged never to have been insane."\n\n"Of course that\u2014that\'s what I meant," he laughed.\n\nI disliked his laugh because I knew it was forced, but I nodded gaily and asked him where he was going. Louis looked after his brother officers who had now almost reached Broadway.\n\n"We had intended to sample a Brunswick cocktail, but to tell you the truth I was anxious for an excuse to go and see Hawberk instead. Come along, I\'ll make you my excuse."\n\nWe found old Hawberk, neatly attired in a fresh spring suit, standing at the door of his shop and sniffing the air.\n\n"I had just decided to take Constance for a little stroll before dinner," he replied to the impetuous volley of questions from Louis. "We thought of walking on the park terrace along the North River."\n\nAt that moment Constance appeared and grew pale and rosy by turns as Louis bent over her small gloved fingers. I tried to excuse myself, alleging an engagement uptown, but Louis and Constance would not listen, and I saw I was expected to remain and engage old Hawberk\'s attention. After all it would be just as well if I kept my eye on Louis, I thought, and when they hailed a Spring Street horse-car, I got in after them and took my seat beside the armourer.\n\nThe beautiful line of parks and granite terraces overlooking the wharves along the North River, which were built in 1910 and finished in the autumn of 1917, had become one of the most popular promenades in the metropolis. They extended from the battery to 190th Street, overlooking the noble river and affording a fine view of the Jersey shore and the Highlands opposite. Caf\xe9s and restaurants were scattered here and there among the trees, and twice a week military bands from the garrison played in the kiosques on the parapets.\n\nWe sat down in the sunshine on the bench at the foot of the equestrian statue of General Sheridan. Constance tipped her sunshade to shield her eyes, and she and Louis began a murmuring conversation which was impossible to catch. Old Hawberk, leaning on his ivory headed cane, lighted an excellent cigar, the mate to which I politely refused, and smiled at vacancy. The sun hung low above the Staten Island woods, and the bay was dyed with golden hues reflected from the sun-warmed sails of the shipping in the harbour.\n\nBrigs, schooners, yachts, clumsy ferry-boats, their decks swarming with people, railroad transports carrying lines of brown, blue and white freight cars, stately sound steamers, d\xe9class\xe9 tramp steamers, coasters, dredgers, scows, and everywhere pervading the entire bay impudent little tugs puffing and whistling officiously;\u2014these were the craft which churned the sunlight waters as far as the eye could reach. In calm contrast to the hurry of sailing vessel and steamer a silent fleet of white warships lay motionless in midstream.\n\nConstance\'s merry laugh aroused me from my reverie.\n\n"What are you staring at?" she inquired.\n\n"Nothing\u2014the fleet," I smiled.\n\nThen Louis told us what the vessels were, pointing out each by its relative position to the old Red Fort on Governor\'s Island.\n\n"That little cigar shaped thing is a torpedo boat," he explained; "there are four more lying close together. They are the Tarpon, the Falcon, the Sea Fox, and the Octopus. The gun-boats just above are the Princeton, the Champlain, the Still Water and the Erie. Next to them lie the cruisers Faragut and Los Angeles, and above them the battle ships California, and Dakota, and the Washington which is the flag ship. Those two squatty looking chunks of metal which are anchored there off Castle William are the double turreted monitors Terrible and Magnificent; behind them lies the ram, Osceola."\n\nConstance looked at him with deep approval in her beautiful eyes. "What loads of things you know for a soldier," she said, and we all joined in the laugh which followed.\n\nPresently Louis rose with a nod to us and offered his arm to Constance, and they strolled away along the river wall. Hawberk watched them for a moment and then turned to me.\n\n"Mr. Wilde was right," he said. "I have found the missing tassets and left cuissard of the \'Prince\'s Emblazoned,\' in a vile old junk garret in Pell Street."\n\n"998?" I inquired, with a smile.\n\n"Yes."\n\n"Mr. Wilde is a very intelligent man," I observed.\n\n"I want to give him the credit of this most important discovery," continued Hawberk. "And I intend it shall be known that he is entitled to the fame of it."\n\n"He won\'t thank you for that," I answered sharply; "please say nothing about it."\n\n"Do you know what it is worth?" said Hawberk.\n\n"No, fifty dollars, perhaps."\n\n"It is valued at five hundred, but the owner of the \'Prince\'s Emblazoned\' will give two thousand dollars to the person who completes his suit; that reward also belongs to Mr. Wilde."\n\n"He doesn\'t want it! He refuses it!" I answered angrily. "What do you know about Mr. Wilde? He doesn\'t need the money. He is rich\u2014or will be\u2014richer than any living man except myself. What will we care for money then\u2014what will we care, he and I, when\u2014when\u2014"\n\n"When what?" demanded Hawberk, astonished.\n\n"You will see," I replied, on my guard again.\n\nHe looked at me narrowly, much as Doctor Archer used to, and I knew he thought I was mentally unsound. Perhaps it was fortunate for him that he did not use the word lunatic just then.\n\n"No," I replied to his unspoken thought, "I am not mentally weak; my mind is as healthy as Mr. Wilde\'s. I do not care to explain just yet what I have on hand, but it is an investment which will pay more than mere gold, silver and precious stones. It will secure the happiness and prosperity of a continent\u2014yes, a hemisphere!"\n\n"Oh," said Hawberk.\n\n"And eventually," I continued more quietly, "it will secure the happiness of the whole world."\n\n"And incidentally your own happiness and prosperity as well as Mr. Wilde\'s?"\n\n"Exactly," I smiled. But I could have throttled him for taking that tone.\n\nHe looked at me in silence for a while and then said very gently, "Why don\'t you give up your books and studies, Mr. Castaigne, and take a tramp among the mountains somewhere or other? You used to be fond of fishing. Take a cast or two at the trout in the Rangelys."\n\n"I don\'t care for fishing any more," I answered, without a shade of annoyance in my voice.\n\n"You used to be fond of everything," he continued; "athletics, yachting, shooting, riding\u2014"\n\n"I have never cared to ride since my fall," I said quietly.\n\n"Ah, yes, your fall," he repeated, looking away from me.\n\nI thought this nonsense had gone far enough, so I brought the conversation back to Mr. Wilde; but he was scanning my face again in a manner highly offensive to me.\n\n"Mr. Wilde," he repeated, "do you know what he did this afternoon? He came downstairs and nailed a sign over the hall door next to mine; it read:\n\nMR. WILDE,\nREPAIRER OF REPUTATIONS.\nThird Bell.\n\n"Do you know what a Repairer of Reputations can be?"\n\n"I do," I replied, suppressing the rage within.\n\n"Oh," he said again.\n\nLouis and Constance came strolling by and stopped to ask if we would join them. Hawberk looked at his watch. At the same moment a puff of smoke shot from the casemates of Castle William, and the boom of the sunset gun rolled across the water and was re-echoed from the Highlands opposite. The flag came running down from the flag-pole, the bugles sounded on the white decks of the warships, and the first electric light sparkled out from the Jersey shore.\n\nAs I turned into the city with Hawberk I heard Constance murmur something to Louis which I did not understand; but Louis whispered "My darling," in reply; and again, walking ahead with Hawberk through the square I heard a murmur of "sweetheart," and "my own Constance," and I knew the time had nearly arrived when I should speak of important matters with my cousin Louis.\nIII\n\nOne morning early in May I stood before the steel safe in my bedroom, trying on the golden jewelled crown. The diamonds flashed fire as I turned to the mirror, and the heavy beaten gold burned like a halo about my head. I remembered Camilla\'s agonized scream and the awful words echoing through the dim streets of Carcosa. They were the last lines in the first act, and I dared not think of what followed\u2014dared not, even in the spring sunshine, there in my own room, surrounded with familiar objects, reassured by the bustle from the street and the voices of the servants in the hallway outside. For those poisoned words had dropped slowly into my heart, as death-sweat drops upon a bed-sheet and is absorbed. Trembling, I put the diadem from my head and wiped my forehead, but I thought of Hastur and of my own rightful ambition, and I remembered Mr. Wilde as I had last left him, his face all torn and bloody from the claws of that devil\'s creature, and what he said\u2014ah, what he said. The alarm bell in the safe began to whirr harshly, and I knew my time was up; but I would not heed it, and replacing the flashing circlet upon my head I turned defiantly to the mirror. I stood for a long time absorbed in the changing expression of my own eyes. The mirror reflected a face which was like my own, but whiter, and so thin that I hardly recognized it. And all the time I kept repeating between my clenched teeth, "The day has come! the day has come!" while the alarm in the safe whirred and clamoured, and the diamonds sparkled and flamed above my brow. I heard a door open but did not heed it. It was only when I saw two faces in the mirror:\u2014it was only when another face rose over my shoulder, and two other eyes met mine. I wheeled like a flash and seized a long knife from my dressing-table, and my cousin sprang back very pale, crying: "Hildred! for God\'s sake!" then as my hand fell, he said: "It is I, Louis, don\'t you know me?" I stood silent. I could not have spoken for my life. He walked up to me and took the knife from my hand.\n\n"What is all this?" he inquired, in a gentle voice. "Are you ill?"\n\n"No," I replied. But I doubt if he heard me.\n\n"Come, come, old fellow," he cried, "take off that brass crown and toddle into the study. Are you going to a masquerade? What\'s all this theatrical tinsel anyway?"\n\nI was glad he thought the crown was made of brass and paste, yet I didn\'t like him any the better for thinking so. I let him take it from my hand, knowing it was best to humour him. He tossed the splendid diadem in the air, and catching it, turned to me smiling.\n\n"It\'s dear at fifty cents," he said. "What\'s it for?"\n\nI did not answer, but took the circlet from his hands, and placing it in the safe shut the massive steel door. The alarm ceased its infernal din at once. He watched me curiously, but did not seem to notice the sudden ceasing of the alarm. He did, however, speak of the safe as a biscuit box. Fearing lest he might examine the combination I led the way into my study. Louis threw himself on the sofa and flicked at flies with his eternal riding-whip. He wore his fatigue uniform with the braided jacket and jaunty cap, and I noticed that his riding-boots were all splashed with red mud.\n\n"Where have you been?" I inquired.\n\n"Jumping mud creeks in Jersey," he said. "I haven\'t had time to change yet; I was rather in a hurry to see you. Haven\'t you got a glass of something? I\'m dead tired; been in the saddle twenty-four hours."\n\nI gave him some brandy from my medicinal store, which he drank with a grimace.\n\n"Damned bad stuff," he observed. "I\'ll give you an address where they sell brandy that is brandy."\n\n"It\'s good enough for my needs," I said indifferently. "I use it to rub my chest with." He stared and flicked at another fly.\n\n"See here, old fellow," he began, "I\'ve got something to suggest to you. It\'s four years now that you\'ve shut yourself up here like an owl, never going anywhere, never taking any healthy exercise, never doing a damn thing but poring over those books up there on the mantelpiece."\n\nHe glanced along the row of shelves. "Napoleon, Napoleon, Napoleon!" he read. "For heaven\'s sake, have you nothing but Napoleons there?"\n\n"I wish they were bound in gold," I said. "But wait, yes, there is another book, The King in Yellow." I looked him steadily in the eye.\n\n"Have you never read it?" I asked.\n\n"I? No, thank God! I don\'t want to be driven crazy."\n\nI saw he regretted his speech as soon as he had uttered it. There is only one word which I loathe more than I do lunatic and that word is crazy. But I controlled myself and asked him why he thought The King in Yellow dangerous.\n\n"Oh, I don\'t know," he said, hastily. "I only remember the excitement it created and the denunciations from pulpit and Press. I believe the author shot himself after bringing forth this monstrosity, didn\'t he?"\n\n"I understand he is still alive," I answered.\n\n"That\'s probably true," he muttered; "bullets couldn\'t kill a fiend like that."\n\n"It is a book of great truths," I said.\n\n"Yes," he replied, "of \'truths\' which send men frantic and blast their lives. I don\'t care if the thing is, as they say, the very supreme essence of art. It\'s a crime to have written it, and I for one shall never open its pages."\n\n"Is that what you have come to tell me?" I asked.\n\n"No," he said, "I came to tell you that I am going to be married."\n\nI believe for a moment my heart ceased to beat, but I kept my eyes on his face.\n\n"Yes," he continued, smiling happily, "married to the sweetest girl on earth."\n\n"Constance Hawberk," I said mechanically.\n\n"How did you know?" he cried, astonished. "I didn\'t know it myself until that evening last April, when we strolled down to the embankment before dinner."\n\n"When is it to be?" I asked.\n\n"It was to have been next September, but an hour ago a despatch came ordering our regiment to the Presidio, San Francisco. We leave at noon to-morrow. To-morrow," he repeated. "Just think, Hildred, to-morrow I shall be the happiest fellow that ever drew breath in this jolly world, for Constance will go with me."\n\nI offered him my hand in congratulation, and he seized and shook it like the good-natured fool he was\u2014or pretended to be.\n\n"I am going to get my squadron as a wedding present," he rattled on. "Captain and Mrs. Louis Castaigne, eh, Hildred?"\n\nThen he told me where it was to be and who were to be there, and made me promise to come and be best man. I set my teeth and listened to his boyish chatter without showing what I felt, but\u2014\n\nI was getting to the limit of my endurance, and when he jumped up, and, switching his spurs till they jingled, said he must go, I did not detain him.\n\n"There\'s one thing I want to ask of you," I said quietly.\n\n"Out with it, it\'s promised," he laughed.\n\n"I want you to meet me for a quarter of an hour\'s talk to-night."\n\n"Of course, if you wish," he said, somewhat puzzled. "Where?"\n\n"Anywhere, in the park there."\n\n"What time, Hildred?"\n\n"Midnight."\n\n"What in the name of\u2014" he began, but checked himself and laughingly assented. I watched him go down the stairs and hurry away, his sabre banging at every stride. He turned into Bleecker Street, and I knew he was going to see Constance. I gave him ten minutes to disappear and then followed in his footsteps, taking with me the jewelled crown and the silken robe embroidered with the Yellow Sign. When I turned into Bleecker Street, and entered the doorway which bore the sign\u2014\n\nMR. WILDE,\nREPAIRER OF REPUTATIONS.\nThird Bell.\n\nI saw old Hawberk moving about in his shop, and imagined I heard Constance\'s voice in the parlour; but I avoided them both and hurried up the trembling stairways to Mr. Wilde\'s apartment. I knocked and entered without ceremony. Mr. Wilde lay groaning on the floor, his face covered with blood, his clothes torn to shreds. Drops of blood were scattered about over the carpet, which had also been ripped and frayed in the evidently recent struggle.\n\n"It\'s that cursed cat," he said, ceasing his groans, and turning his colourless eyes to me; "she attacked me while I was asleep. I believe she will kill me yet."\n\nThis was too much, so I went into the kitchen, and, seizing a hatchet from the pantry, started to find the infernal beast and settle her then and there. My search was fruitless, and after a while I gave it up and came back to find Mr. Wilde squatting on his high chair by the table. He had washed his face and changed his clothes. The great furrows which the cat\'s claws had ploughed up in his face he had filled with collodion, and a rag hid the wound in his throat. I told him I should kill the cat when I came across her, but he only shook his head and turned to the open ledger before him. He read name after name of the people who had come to him in regard to their reputation, and the sums he had amassed were startling.\n\n"I put on the screws now and then," he explained.\n\n"One day or other some of these people will assassinate you," I insisted.\n\n"Do you think so?" he said, rubbing his mutilated ears.\n\nIt was useless to argue with him, so I took down the manuscript entitled Imperial Dynasty of America, for the last time I should ever take it down in Mr. Wilde\'s study. I read it through, thrilling and trembling with pleasure. When I had finished Mr. Wilde took the manuscript and, turning to the dark passage which leads from his study to his bed-chamber, called out in a loud voice, "Vance." Then for the first time, I noticed a man crouching there in the shadow. How I had overlooked him during my search for the cat, I cannot imagine.\n\n"Vance, come in," cried Mr. Wilde.\n\nThe figure rose and crept towards us, and I shall never forget the face that he raised to mine, as the light from the window illuminated it.\n\n"Vance, this is Mr. Castaigne," said Mr. Wilde. Before he had finished speaking, the man threw himself on the ground before the table, crying and grasping, "Oh, God! Oh, my God! Help me! Forgive me! Oh, Mr. Castaigne, keep that man away. You cannot, you cannot mean it! You are different\u2014save me! I am broken down\u2014I was in a madhouse and now\u2014when all was coming right\u2014when I had forgotten the King\u2014the King in Yellow and\u2014but I shall go mad again\u2014I shall go mad\u2014"\n\nHis voice died into a choking rattle, for Mr. Wilde had leapt on him and his right hand encircled the man\'s throat. When Vance fell in a heap on the floor, Mr. Wilde clambered nimbly into his chair again, and rubbing his mangled ears with the stump of his hand, turned to me and asked me for the ledger. I reached it down from the shelf and he opened it. After a moment\'s searching among the beautifully written pages, he coughed complacently, and pointed to the name Vance.\n\n"Vance," he read aloud, "Osgood Oswald Vance." At the sound of his name, the man on the floor raised his head and turned a convulsed face to Mr. Wilde. His eyes were injected with blood, his lips tumefied. "Called April 28th," continued Mr. Wilde. "Occupation, cashier in the Seaforth National Bank; has served a term of forgery at Sing Sing, from whence he was transferred to the Asylum for the Criminal Insane. Pardoned by the Governor of New York, and discharged from the Asylum, January 19, 1918. Reputation damaged at Sheepshead Bay. Rumours that he lives beyond his income. Reputation to be repaired at once. Retainer $1,500.\n\n"Note.\u2014Has embezzled sums amounting to $30,000 since March 20, 1919, excellent family, and secured present position through uncle\'s influence. Father, President of Seaforth Bank."\n\nI looked at the man on the floor.\n\n"Get up, Vance," said Mr. Wilde in a gentle voice. Vance rose as if hypnotized. "He will do as we suggest now," observed Mr. Wilde, and opening the manuscript, he read the entire history of the Imperial Dynasty of America. Then in a kind and soothing murmur he ran over the important points with Vance, who stood like one stunned. His eyes were so blank and vacant that I imagined he had become half-witted, and remarked it to Mr. Wilde who replied that it was of no consequence anyway. Very patiently we pointed out to Vance what his share in the affair would be, and he seemed to understand after a while. Mr. Wilde explained the manuscript, using several volumes on Heraldry, to substantiate the result of his researches. He mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. "The scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever," he muttered, but I do not believe Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he began the wonderful story of the Last King. Fascinated and thrilled I watched him. He threw up his head, his long arms were stretched out in a magnificent gesture of pride and power, and his eyes blazed deep in their sockets like two emeralds. Vance listened stupefied. As for me, when at last Mr. Wilde had finished, and pointing to me, cried, "The cousin of the King!" my head swam with excitement.\n\nControlling myself with a superhuman effort, I explained to Vance why I alone was worthy of the crown and why my cousin must be exiled or die. I made him understand that my cousin must never marry, even after renouncing all his claims, and how that least of all he should marry the daughter of the Marquis of Avonshire and bring England into the question. I showed him a list of thousands of names which Mr. Wilde had drawn up; every man whose name was there had received the Yellow Sign which no living human being dared disregard. The city, the state, the whole land, were ready to rise and tremble before the Pallid Mask.\n\nThe time had come, the people should know the son of Hastur, and the whole world bow to the black stars which hang in the sky over Carcosa.\n\nVance leaned on the table, his head buried in his hands. Mr. Wilde drew a rough sketch on the margin of yesterday\'s Herald with a bit of lead pencil. It was a plan of Hawberk\'s rooms. Then he wrote out the order and affixed the seal, and shaking like a palsied man I signed my first writ of execution with my name Hildred-Rex.\n\nMr. Wilde clambered to the floor and unlocking the cabinet, took a long square box from the first shelf. This he brought to the table and opened. A new knife lay in the tissue paper inside and I picked it up and handed it to Vance, along with the order and the plan of Hawberk\'s apartment. Then Mr. Wilde told Vance he could go; and he went, shambling like an outcast of the slums.\n\nI sat for a while watching the daylight fade behind the square tower of the Judson Memorial Church, and finally, gathering up the manuscript and notes, took my hat and started for the door.\n\nMr. Wilde watched me in silence. When I had stepped into the hall I looked back. Mr. Wilde\'s small eyes were still fixed on me. Behind him, the shadows gathered in the fading light. Then I closed the door behind me and went out into the darkening streets.\n\nI had eaten nothing since breakfast, but I was not hungry. A wretched, half-starved creature, who stood looking across the street at the Lethal Chamber, noticed me and came up to tell me a tale of misery. I gave him money, I don\'t know why, and he went away without thanking me. An hour later another outcast approached and whined his story. I had a blank bit of paper in my pocket, on which was traced the Yellow Sign, and I handed it to him. He looked at it stupidly for a moment, and then with an uncertain glance at me, folded it with what seemed to me exaggerated care and placed it in his bosom.\n\nThe electric lights were sparkling among the trees, and the new moon shone in the sky above the Lethal Chamber. It was tiresome waiting in the square; I wandered from the Marble Arch to the artillery stables and back again to the lotos fountain. The flowers and grass exhaled a fragrance which troubled me. The jet of the fountain played in the moonlight, and the musical splash of falling drops reminded me of the tinkle of chained mail in Hawberk\'s shop. But it was not so fascinating, and the dull sparkle of the moonlight on the water brought no such sensations of exquisite pleasure, as when the sunshine played over the polished steel of a corselet on Hawberk\'s knee. I watched the bats darting and turning above the water plants in the fountain basin, but their rapid, jerky flight set my nerves on edge, and I went away again to walk aimlessly to and fro among the trees.\n\nThe artillery stables were dark, but in the cavalry barracks the officers\' windows were brilliantly lighted, and the sallyport was constantly filled with troopers in fatigue, carrying straw and harness and baskets filled with tin dishes.\n\nTwice the mounted sentry at the gates was changed while I wandered up and down the asphalt walk. I looked at my watch. It was nearly time. The lights in the barracks went out one by one, the barred gate was closed, and every minute or two an officer passed in through the side wicket, leaving a rattle of accoutrements and a jingle of spurs on the night air. The square had become very silent. The last homeless loiterer had been driven away by the grey-coated park policeman, the car tracks along Wooster Street were deserted, and the only sound which broke the stillness was the stamping of the sentry\'s horse and the ring of his sabre against the saddle pommel. In the barracks, the officers\' quarters were still lighted, and military servants passed and repassed before the bay windows. Twelve o\'clock sounded from the new spire of St. Francis Xavier, and at the last stroke of the sad-toned bell a figure passed through the wicket beside the portcullis, returned the salute of the sentry, and crossing the street entered the square and advanced toward the Benedick apartment house.\n\n"Louis," I called.\n\nThe man pivoted on his spurred heels and came straight toward me.\n\n"Is that you, Hildred?"\n\n"Yes, you are on time."\n\nI took his offered hand, and we strolled toward the Lethal Chamber.\n\nHe rattled on about his wedding and the graces of Constance, and their future prospects, calling my attention to his captain\'s shoulder-straps, and the triple gold arabesque on his sleeve and fatigue cap. I believe I listened as much to the music of his spurs and sabre as I did to his boyish babble, and at last we stood under the elms on the Fourth Street corner of the square opposite the Lethal Chamber. Then he laughed and asked me what I wanted with him. I motioned him to a seat on a bench under the electric light, and sat down beside him. He looked at me curiously, with that same searching glance which I hate and fear so in doctors. I felt the insult of his look, but he did not know it, and I carefully concealed my feelings.\n\n"Well, old chap," he inquired, "what can I do for you?"\n\nI drew from my pocket the manuscript and notes of the Imperial Dynasty of America, and looking him in the eye said:\n\n"I will tell you. On your word as a soldier, promise me to read this manuscript from beginning to end, without asking me a question. Promise me to read these notes in the same way, and promise me to listen to what I have to tell later."\n\n"I promise, if you wish it," he said pleasantly. "Give me the paper, Hildred."\n\nHe began to read, raising his eyebrows with a puzzled, whimsical air, which made me tremble with suppressed anger. As he advanced his, eyebrows contracted, and his lips seemed to form the word "rubbish."\n\nThen he looked slightly bored, but apparently for my sake read, with an attempt at interest, which presently ceased to be an effort. He started when in the closely written pages he came to his own name, and when he came to mine he lowered the paper, and looked sharply at me for a moment. But he kept his word, and resumed his reading, and I let the half-formed question die on his lips unanswered. When he came to the end and read the signature of Mr. Wilde, he folded the paper carefully and returned it to me. I handed him the notes, and he settled back, pushing his fatigue cap up to his forehead, with a boyish gesture, which I remembered so well in school. I watched his face as he read, and when he finished I took the notes with the manuscript, and placed them in my pocket. Then I unfolded a scroll marked with the Yellow Sign. He saw the sign, but he did not seem to recognize it, and I called his attention to it somewhat sharply.\n\n"Well," he said, "I see it. What is it?"\n\n"It is the Yellow Sign," I said angrily.\n\n"Oh, that\'s it, is it?" said Louis, in that flattering voice, which Doctor Archer used to employ with me, and would probably have employed again, had I not settled his affair for him.\n\nI kept my rage down and answered as steadily as possible, "Listen, you have engaged your word?"\n\n"I am listening, old chap," he replied soothingly.\n\nI began to speak very calmly.\n\n"Dr. Archer, having by some means become possessed of the secret of the Imperial Succession, attempted to deprive me of my right, alleging that because of a fall from my horse four years ago, I had become mentally deficient. He presumed to place me under restraint in his own house in hopes of either driving me insane or poisoning me. I have not forgotten it. I visited him last night and the interview was final."\n\nLouis turned quite pale, but did not move. I resumed triumphantly, "There are yet three people to be interviewed in the interests of Mr. Wilde and myself. They are my cousin Louis, Mr. Hawberk, and his daughter Constance."\n\nLouis sprang to his feet and I arose also, and flung the paper marked with the Yellow Sign to the ground.\n\n"Oh, I don\'t need that to tell you what I have to say," I cried, with a laugh of triumph. "You must renounce the crown to me, do you hear, to me."\n\nLouis looked at me with a startled air, but recovering himself said kindly, "Of course I renounce the\u2014what is it I must renounce?"\n\n"The crown," I said angrily.\n\n"Of course," he answered, "I renounce it. Come, old chap, I\'ll walk back to your rooms with you."\n\n"Don\'t try any of your doctor\'s tricks on me," I cried, trembling with fury. "Don\'t act as if you think I am insane."\n\n"What nonsense," he replied. "Come, it\'s getting late, Hildred."\n\n"No," I shouted, "you must listen. You cannot marry, I forbid it. Do you hear? I forbid it. You shall renounce the crown, and in reward I grant you exile, but if you refuse you shall die."\n\nHe tried to calm me, but I was roused at last, and drawing my long knife barred his way.\n\nThen I told him how they would find Dr. Archer in the cellar with his throat open, and I laughed in his face when I thought of Vance and his knife, and the order signed by me.\n\n"Ah, you are the King," I cried, "but I shall be King. Who are you to keep me from Empire over all the habitable earth! I was born the cousin of a king, but I shall be King!"\n\nLouis stood white and rigid before me. Suddenly a man came running up Fourth Street, entered the gate of the Lethal Temple, traversed the path to the bronze doors at full speed, and plunged into the death chamber with the cry of one demented, and I laughed until I wept tears, for I had recognized Vance, and knew that Hawberk and his daughter were no longer in my way.\n\n"Go," I cried to Louis, "you have ceased to be a menace. You will never marry Constance now, and if you marry any one else in your exile, I will visit you as I did my doctor last night. Mr. Wilde takes charge of you to-morrow." Then I turned and darted into South Fifth Avenue, and with a cry of terror Louis dropped his belt and sabre and followed me like the wind. I heard him close behind me at the corner of Bleecker Street, and I dashed into the doorway under Hawberk\'s sign. He cried, "Halt, or I fire!" but when he saw that I flew up the stairs leaving Hawberk\'s shop below, he left me, and I heard him hammering and shouting at their door as though it were possible to arouse the dead.\n\nMr. Wilde\'s door was open, and I entered crying, "It is done, it is done! Let the nations rise and look upon their King!" but I could not find Mr. Wilde, so I went to the cabinet and took the splendid diadem from its case. Then I drew on the white silk robe, embroidered with the Yellow Sign, and placed the crown upon my head. At last I was King, King by my right in Hastur, King because I knew the mystery of the Hyades, and my mind had sounded the depths of the Lake of Hali. I was King! The first grey pencillings of dawn would raise a tempest which would shake two hemispheres. Then as I stood, my every nerve pitched to the highest tension, faint with the joy and splendour of my thought, without, in the dark passage, a man groaned.\n\nI seized the tallow dip and sprang to the door. The cat passed me like a demon, and the tallow dip went out, but my long knife flew swifter than she, and I heard her screech, and I knew that my knife had found her. For a moment I listened to her tumbling and thumping about in the darkness, and then when her frenzy ceased, I lighted a lamp and raised it over my head. Mr. Wilde lay on the floor with his throat torn open. At first I thought he was dead, but as I looked, a green sparkle came into his sunken eyes, his mutilated hand trembled, and then a spasm stretched his mouth from ear to ear. For a moment my terror and despair gave place to hope, but as I bent over him his eyeballs rolled clean around in his head, and he died. Then while I stood, transfixed with rage and despair, seeing my crown, my empire, every hope and every ambition, my very life, lying prostrate there with the dead master, they came, seized me from behind, and bound me until my veins stood out like cords, and my voice failed with the paroxysms of my frenzied screams. But I still raged, bleeding and infuriated among them, and more than one policeman felt my sharp teeth. Then when I could no longer move they came nearer; I saw old Hawberk, and behind him my cousin Louis\' ghastly face, and farther away, in the corner, a woman, Constance, weeping softly.\n\n"Ah! I see it now!" I shrieked. "You have seized the throne and the empire. Woe! woe to you who are crowned with the crown of the King in Yellow!"\n\n[EDITOR\'S NOTE.\u2014Mr. Castaigne died yesterday in the Asylum for Criminal Insane.]\nTHE MASK\nCamilla: You, sir, should unmask.\nStranger: Indeed?\nCassilda: Indeed it\'s time.

He picked up an Easter lily which Genevi\xe8ve had brought that morning from Notre Dame, and dropped it into the basin. Instantly the liquid lost its crystalline clearness. For a second the lily was enveloped in a milk-white foam, which disappeared, leaving the fluid opalescent. Changing tints of orange and crimson played over the surface, and then what seemed to be a ray of pure sunlight struck through from the bottom where the lily was resting. At the same instant he plunged his hand into the basin and drew out the flower. "There is no danger," he explained, "if you choose the right moment. That golden ray is the signal."\n\nHe held the lily toward me, and I took it in my hand. It had turned to stone, to the purest marble.\n\n"You see," he said, "it is without a flaw. What sculptor could reproduce it?"\n\nThe marble was white as snow, but in its depths the veins of the lily were tinged with palest azure, and a faint flush lingered deep in its heart.\n\n"Don\'t ask me the reason of that," he smiled, noticing my wonder. "I have no idea why the veins and heart are tinted, but they always are. Yesterday I tried one of Genevi\xe8ve\'s gold-fish,\u2014there it is."\n\nThe fish looked as if sculptured in marble. But if you held it to the light the stone was beautifully veined with a faint blue, and from somewhere within came a rosy light like the tint which slumbers in an opal. I looked into the basin. Once more it seemed filled with clearest crystal.\n\n"If I should touch it now?" I demanded.\n\n"I don\'t know," he replied, "but you had better not try."\n\n"There is one thing I\'m curious about," I said, "and that is where the ray of sunlight came from."\n\n"It looked like a sunbeam true enough," he said. "I don\'t know, it always comes when I immerse any living thing. Perhaps," he continued, smiling, "perhaps it is the vital spark of the creature escaping to the source from whence it came."\n\nI saw he was mocking, and threatened him with a mahl-stick, but he only laughed and changed the subject.\n\n"Stay to lunch. Genevi\xe8ve will be here directly."\n\n"I saw her going to early mass," I said, "and she looked as fresh and sweet as that lily\u2014before you destroyed it."\n\n"Do you think I destroyed it?" said Boris gravely.\n\n"Destroyed, preserved, how can we tell?"\n\nWe sat in the corner of a studio near his unfinished group of the "Fates." He leaned back on the sofa, twirling a sculptor\'s chisel and squinting at his work.\n\n"By the way," he said, "I have finished pointing up that old academic Ariadne, and I suppose it will have to go to the Salon. It\'s all I have ready this year, but after the success the \'Madonna\' brought me I feel ashamed to send a thing like that."\n\nThe "Madonna," an exquisite marble for which Genevi\xe8ve had sat, had been the sensation of last year\'s Salon. I looked at the Ariadne. It was a magnificent piece of technical work, but I agreed with Boris that the world would expect something better of him than that. Still, it was impossible now to think of finishing in time for the Salon that splendid terrible group half shrouded in the marble behind me. The "Fates" would have to wait.\n\nWe were proud of Boris Yvain. We claimed him and he claimed us on the strength of his having been born in America, although his father was French and his mother was a Russian. Every one in the Beaux Arts called him Boris. And yet there were only two of us whom he addressed in the same familiar way\u2014Jack Scott and myself.\n\nPerhaps my being in love with Genevi\xe8ve had something to do with his affection for me. Not that it had ever been acknowledged between us. But after all was settled, and she had told me with tears in her eyes that it was Boris whom she loved, I went over to his house and congratulated him. The perfect cordiality of that interview did not deceive either of us, I always believed, although to one at least it was a great comfort. I do not think he and Genevi\xe8ve ever spoke of the matter together, but Boris knew.\n\nGenevi\xe8ve was lovely. The Madonna-like purity of her face might have been inspired by the Sanctus in Gounod\'s Mass. But I was always glad when she changed that mood for what we called her "April Man\u0153uvres." She was often as variable as an April day. In the morning grave, dignified and sweet, at noon laughing, capricious, at evening whatever one least expected. I preferred her so rather than in that Madonna-like tranquillity which stirred the depths of my heart. I was dreaming of Genevi\xe8ve when he spoke again.\n\n"What do you think of my discovery, Alec?"\n\n"I think it wonderful."\n\n"I shall make no use of it, you know, beyond satisfying my own curiosity so far as may be, and the secret will die with me."\n\n"It would be rather a blow to sculpture, would it not? We painters lose more than we ever gain by photography."\n\nBoris nodded, playing with the edge of the chisel.\n\n"This new vicious discovery would corrupt the world of art. No, I shall never confide the secret to any one," he said slowly.\n\nIt would be hard to find any one less informed about such phenomena than myself; but of course I had heard of mineral springs so saturated with silica that the leaves and twigs which fell into them were turned to stone after a time. I dimly comprehended the process, how the silica replaced the vegetable matter, atom by atom, and the result was a duplicate of the object in stone. This, I confess, had never interested me greatly, and as for the ancient fossils thus produced, they disgusted me. Boris, it appeared, feeling curiosity instead of repugnance, had investigated the subject, and had accidentally stumbled on a solution which, attacking the immersed object with a ferocity unheard of, in a second did the work of years. This was all I could make out of the strange story he had just been telling me. He spoke again after a long silence.\n\n"I am almost frightened when I think what I have found. Scientists would go mad over the discovery. It was so simple too; it discovered itself. When I think of that formula, and that new element precipitated in metallic scales\u2014"\n\n"What new element?"\n\n"Oh, I haven\'t thought of naming it, and I don\'t believe I ever shall. There are enough precious metals now in the world to cut throats over."\n\nI pricked up my ears. "Have you struck gold, Boris?"\n\n"No, better;\u2014but see here, Alec!" he laughed, starting up. "You and I have all we need in this world. Ah! how sinister and covetous you look already!" I laughed too, and told him I was devoured by the desire for gold, and we had better talk of something else; so when Genevi\xe8ve came in shortly after, we had turned our backs on alchemy.\n\nGenevi\xe8ve was dressed in silvery grey from head to foot. The light glinted along the soft curves of her fair hair as she turned her cheek to Boris; then she saw me and returned my greeting. She had never before failed to blow me a kiss from the tips of her white fingers, and I promptly complained of the omission. She smiled and held out her hand, which dropped almost before it had touched mine; then she said, looking at Boris\u2014\n\n"You must ask Alec to stay for luncheon." This also was something new. She had always asked me herself until to-day.\n\n"I did," said Boris shortly.\n\n"And you said yes, I hope?" She turned to me with a charming conventional smile. I might have been an acquaintance of the day before yesterday. I made her a low bow. "J\'avais bien l\'honneur, madame," but refusing to take up our usual bantering tone, she murmured a hospitable commonplace and disappeared. Boris and I looked at one another.\n\n"I had better go home, don\'t you think?" I asked.\n\n"Hanged if I know," he replied frankly.\n\nWhile we were discussing the advisability of my departure Genevi\xe8ve reappeared in the doorway without her bonnet. She was wonderfully beautiful, but her colour was too deep and her lovely eyes were too bright. She came straight up to me and took my arm.\n\n"Luncheon is ready. Was I cross, Alec? I thought I had a headache, but I haven\'t. Come here, Boris;" and she slipped her other arm through his. "Alec knows that after you there is no one in the world whom I like as well as I like him, so if he sometimes feels snubbed it won\'t hurt him."\n\n"\xc0 la bonheur!" I cried, "who says there are no thunderstorms in April?"\n\n"Are you ready?" chanted Boris. "Aye ready;" and arm-in-arm we raced into the dining-room, scandalizing the servants. After all we were not so much to blame; Genevi\xe8ve was eighteen, Boris was twenty-three, and I not quite twenty-one.\nII\n\nSome work that I was doing about this time on the decorations for Genevi\xe8ve\'s boudoir kept me constantly at the quaint little hotel in the Rue Sainte-C\xe9cile. Boris and I in those days laboured hard but as we pleased, which was fitfully, and we all three, with Jack Scott, idled a great deal together.\n\nOne quiet afternoon I had been wandering alone over the house examining curios, prying into odd corners, bringing out sweetmeats and cigars from strange hiding-places, and at last I stopped in the bathing-room. Boris, all over clay, stood there washing his hands.\n\nThe room was built of rose-coloured marble excepting the floor, which was tessellated in rose and grey. In the centre was a square pool sunken below the surface of the floor; steps led down into it, sculptured pillars supported a frescoed ceiling. A delicious marble Cupid appeared to have just alighted on his pedestal at the upper end of the room. The whole interior was Boris\' work and mine. Boris, in his working-clothes of white canvas, scraped the traces of clay and red modelling wax from his handsome hands, and coquetted over his shoulder with the Cupid.\n\n"I see you," he insisted, "don\'t try to look the other way and pretend not to see me. You know who made you, little humbug!"\n\nIt was always my r\xf4le to interpret Cupid\'s sentiments in these conversations, and when my turn came I responded in such a manner, that Boris seized my arm and dragged me toward the pool, declaring he would duck me. Next instant he dropped my arm and turned pale. "Good God!" he said, "I forgot the pool is full of the solution!"\n\nI shivered a little, and dryly advised him to remember better where he had stored the precious liquid.\n\n"In Heaven\'s name, why do you keep a small lake of that gruesome stuff here of all places?" I asked.\n\n"I want to experiment on something large," he replied.\n\n"On me, for instance?"\n\n"Ah! that came too close for jesting; but I do want to watch the action of that solution on a more highly organized living body; there is that big white rabbit," he said, following me into the studio.\n\nJack Scott, wearing a paint-stained jacket, came wandering in, appropriated all the Oriental sweetmeats he could lay his hands on, looted the cigarette case, and finally he and Boris disappeared together to visit the Luxembourg Gallery, where a new silver bronze by Rodin and a landscape of Monet\'s were claiming the exclusive attention of artistic France. I went back to the studio, and resumed my work. It was a Renaissance screen, which Boris wanted me to paint for Genevi\xe8ve\'s boudoir. But the small boy who was unwillingly dawdling through a series of poses for it, to-day refused all bribes to be good. He never rested an instant in the same position, and inside of five minutes I had as many different outlines of the little beggar.\n\n"Are you posing, or are you executing a song and dance, my friend?" I inquired.\n\n"Whichever monsieur pleases," he replied, with an angelic smile.\n\nOf course I dismissed him for the day, and of course I paid him for the full time, that being the way we spoil our models.\n\nAfter the young imp had gone, I made a few perfunctory daubs at my work, but was so thoroughly out of humour, that it took me the rest of the afternoon to undo the damage I had done, so at last I scraped my palette, stuck my brushes in a bowl of black soap, and strolled into the smoking-room. I really believe that, excepting Genevi\xe8ve\'s apartments, no room in the house was so free from the perfume of tobacco as this one. It was a queer chaos of odds and ends, hung with threadbare tapestry. A sweet-toned old spinet in good repair stood by the window. There were stands of weapons, some old and dull, others bright and modern, festoons of Indian and Turkish armour over the mantel, two or three good pictures, and a pipe-rack. It was here that we used to come for new sensations in smoking. I doubt if any type of pipe ever existed which was not represented in that rack. When we had selected one, we immediately carried it somewhere else and smoked it; for the place was, on the whole, more gloomy and less inviting than any in the house. But this afternoon, the twilight was very soothing, the rugs and skins on the floor looked brown and soft and drowsy; the big couch was piled with cushions\u2014I found my pipe and curled up there for an unaccustomed smoke in the smoking-room. I had chosen one with a long flexible stem, and lighting it fell to dreaming. After a while it went out, but I did not stir. I dreamed on and presently fell asleep.\n\nI awoke to the saddest music I had ever heard. The room was quite dark, I had no idea what time it was. A ray of moonlight silvered one edge of the old spinet, and the polished wood seemed to exhale the sounds as perfume floats above a box of sandalwood. Some one rose in the darkness, and came away weeping quietly, and I was fool enough to cry out "Genevi\xe8ve!"\n\nShe dropped at my voice, and, I had time to curse myself while I made a light and tried to raise her from the floor. She shrank away with a murmur of pain. She was very quiet, and asked for Boris. I carried her to the divan, and went to look for him, but he was not in the house, and the servants were gone to bed. Perplexed and anxious, I hurried back to Genevi\xe8ve. She lay where I had left her, looking very white.\n\n"I can\'t find Boris nor any of the servants," I said.\n\n"I know," she answered faintly, "Boris has gone to Ept with Mr. Scott. I did not remember when I sent you for him just now."\n\n"But he can\'t get back in that case before to-morrow afternoon, and\u2014are you hurt? Did I frighten you into falling? What an awful fool I am, but I was only half awake."\n\n"Boris thought you had gone home before dinner. Do please excuse us for letting you stay here all this time."\n\n"I have had a long nap," I laughed, "so sound that I did not know whether I was still asleep or not when I found myself staring at a figure that was moving toward me, and called out your name. Have you been trying the old spinet? You must have played very softly."\n\nI would tell a thousand more lies worse than that one to see the look of relief that came into her face. She smiled adorably, and said in her natural voice: "Alec, I tripped on that wolf\'s head, and I think my ankle is sprained. Please call Marie, and then go home."\n\nI did as she bade me, and left her there when the maid came in.\nIII\n\nAt noon next day when I called, I found Boris walking restlessly about his studio.\n\n"Genevi\xe8ve is asleep just now," he told me, "the sprain is nothing, but why should she have such a high fever? The doctor can\'t account for it; or else he will not," he muttered.\n\n"Genevi\xe8ve has a fever?" I asked.\n\n"I should say so, and has actually been a little light-headed at intervals all night. The idea!\u2014gay little Genevi\xe8ve, without a care in the world,\u2014and she keeps saying her heart\'s broken, and she wants to die!"\n\nMy own heart stood still.\n\nBoris leaned against the door of his studio, looking down, his hands in his pockets, his kind, keen eyes clouded, a new line of trouble drawn "over the mouth\'s good mark, that made the smile." The maid had orders to summon him the instant Genevi\xe8ve opened her eyes. We waited and waited, and Boris, growing restless, wandered about, fussing with modelling wax and red clay. Suddenly he started for the next room. "Come and see my rose-coloured bath full of death!" he cried.\n\n"Is it death?" I asked, to humour his mood.\n\n"You are not prepared to call it life, I suppose," he answered. As he spoke he plucked a solitary gold-fish squirming and twisting out of its globe. "We\'ll send this one after the other\u2014wherever that is," he said. There was feverish excitement in his voice. A dull weight of fever lay on my limbs and on my brain as I followed him to the fair crystal pool with its pink-tinted sides; and he dropped the creature in. Falling, its scales flashed with a hot orange gleam in its angry twistings and contortions; the moment it struck the liquid it became rigid and sank heavily to the bottom. Then came the milky foam, the splendid hues radiating on the surface and then the shaft of pure serene light broke through from seemingly infinite depths. Boris plunged in his hand and drew out an exquisite marble thing, blue-veined, rose-tinted, and glistening with opalescent drops.\n\n"Child\'s play," he muttered, and looked wearily, longingly at me,\u2014as if I could answer such questions! But Jack Scott came in and entered into the "game," as he called it, with ardour. Nothing would do but to try the experiment on the white rabbit then and there. I was willing that Boris should find distraction from his cares, but I hated to see the life go out of a warm, living creature and I declined to be present. Picking up a book at random, I sat down in the studio to read. Alas! I had found The King in Yellow. After a few moments, which seemed ages, I was putting it away with a nervous shudder, when Boris and Jack came in bringing their marble rabbit. At the same time the bell rang above, and a cry came from the sick-room. Boris was gone like a flash, and the next moment he called, "Jack, run for the doctor; bring him back with you. Alec, come here."\n\nI went and stood at her door. A frightened maid came out in haste and ran away to fetch some remedy. Genevi\xe8ve, sitting bolt upright, with crimson cheeks and glittering eyes, babbled incessantly and resisted Boris\' gentle restraint. He called me to help. At my first touch she sighed and sank back, closing her eyes, and then\u2014then\u2014as we still bent above her, she opened them again, looked straight into Boris\' face\u2014poor fever-crazed girl!\u2014and told her secret. At the same instant our three lives turned into new channels; the bond that held us so long together snapped for ever and a new bond was forged in its place, for she had spoken my name, and as the fever tortured her, her heart poured out its load of hidden sorrow. Amazed and dumb I bowed my head, while my face burned like a live coal, and the blood surged in my ears, stupefying me with its clamour. Incapable of movement, incapable of speech, I listened to her feverish words in an agony of shame and sorrow. I could not silence her, I could not look at Boris. Then I felt an arm upon my shoulder, and Boris turned a bloodless face to mine.\n\n"It is not your fault, Alec; don\'t grieve so if she loves you\u2014" but he could not finish; and as the doctor stepped swiftly into the room, saying\u2014"Ah, the fever!" I seized Jack Scott and hurried him to the street, saying, "Boris would rather be alone." We crossed the street to our own apartments, and that night, seeing I was going to be ill too, he went for the doctor again. The last thing I recollect with any distinctness was hearing Jack say, "For Heaven\'s sake, doctor, what ails him, to wear a face like that?" and I thought of The King in Yellow and the Pallid Mask.\n\nI was very ill, for the strain of two years which I had endured since that fatal May morning when Genevi\xe8ve murmured, "I love you, but I think I love Boris best," told on me at last. I had never imagined that it could become more than I could endure. Outwardly tranquil, I had deceived myself. Although the inward battle raged night after night, and I, lying alone in my room, cursed myself for rebellious thoughts unloyal to Boris and unworthy of Genevi\xe8ve, the morning always brought relief, and I returned to Genevi\xe8ve and to my dear Boris with a heart washed clean by the tempests of the night.\n\nNever in word or deed or thought while with them had I betrayed my sorrow even to myself.\n\nThe mask of self-deception was no longer a mask for me, it was a part of me. Night lifted it, laying bare the stifled truth below; but there was no one to see except myself, and when the day broke the mask fell back again of its own accord. These thoughts passed through my troubled mind as I lay sick, but they were hopelessly entangled with visions of white creatures, heavy as stone, crawling about in Boris\' basin,\u2014of the wolf\'s head on the rug, foaming and snapping at Genevi\xe8ve, who lay smiling beside it. I thought, too, of the King in Yellow wrapped in the fantastic colours of his tattered mantle, and that bitter cry of Cassilda, "Not upon us, oh King, not upon us!" Feverishly I struggled to put it from me, but I saw the lake of Hali, thin and blank, without a ripple or wind to stir it, and I saw the towers of Carcosa behind the moon. Aldebaran, the Hyades, Alar, Hastur, glided through the cloud-rifts which fluttered and flapped as they passed like the scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow. Among all these, one sane thought persisted. It never wavered, no matter what else was going on in my disordered mind, that my chief reason for existing was to meet some requirement of Boris and Genevi\xe8ve. What this obligation was, its nature, was never clear; sometimes it seemed to be protection, sometimes support, through a great crisis. Whatever it seemed to be for the time, its weight rested only on me, and I was never so ill or so weak that I did not respond with my whole soul. There were always crowds of faces about me, mostly strange, but a few I recognized, Boris among them. Afterward they told me that this could not have been, but I know that once at least he bent over me. It was only a touch, a faint echo of his voice, then the clouds settled back on my senses, and I lost him, but he did stand there and bend over me once at least.\n\nAt last, one morning I awoke to find the sunlight falling across my bed, and Jack Scott reading beside me. I had not strength enough to speak aloud, neither could I think, much less remember, but I could smile feebly, as Jack\'s eye met mine, and when he jumped up and asked eagerly if I wanted anything, I could whisper, "Yes\u2014Boris." Jack moved to the head of my bed, and leaned down to arrange my pillow: I did not see his face, but he answered heartily, "You must wait, Alec; you are too weak to see even Boris."\n\nI waited and I grew strong; in a few days I was able to see whom I would, but meanwhile I had thought and remembered. From the moment when all the past grew clear again in my mind, I never doubted what I should do when the time came, and I felt sure that Boris would have resolved upon the same course so far as he was concerned; as for what pertained to me alone, I knew he would see that also as I did. I no longer asked for any one. I never inquired why no message came from them; why during the week I lay there, waiting and growing stronger, I never heard their name spoken. Preoccupied with my own searchings for the right way, and with my feeble but determined fight against despair, I simply acquiesced in Jack\'s reticence, taking for granted that he was afraid to speak of them, lest I should turn unruly and insist on seeing them. Meanwhile I said over and over to myself, how would it be when life began again for us all? We would take up our relations exactly as they were before Genevi\xe8ve fell ill. Boris and I would look into each other\'s eyes, and there would be neither rancour nor cowardice nor mistrust in that glance. I would be with them again for a little while in the dear intimacy of their home, and then, without pretext or explanation, I would disappear from their lives for ever. Boris would know; Genevi\xe8ve\u2014the only comfort was that she would never know. It seemed, as I thought it over, that I had found the meaning of that sense of obligation which had persisted all through my delirium, and the only possible answer to it. So, when I was quite ready, I beckoned Jack to me one day, and said\u2014\n\n"Jack, I want Boris at once; and take my dearest greeting to Genevi\xe8ve...."'},{title:"The Little Gray Lady",author:"Francis Hopkinson Smith",gender:"Male",text:"Once in a while there come to me out of the long ago the fragments of a story I have not thought of for years\u2014one that has been hidden in the dim lumber-room of my brain where I store my by-gone memories.\n\nThese fragments thrust themselves out of the past as do the cuffs of an old-fashioned coat, the flutings of a flounce, or the lacings of a bodice from out a quickly opened bureau drawer.

And so must her cobwebbed silk stockings and the filmy kerchief she folds across her bosom:\n\nIt is this kind of a drawer that I am opening now\u2014one belonging to the Little Gray Lady.\n\nAs I look through its contents my eyes resting on the finger of a glove, the end of a lace scarf, and the handle of an old fan, my mind goes back to the last time she wore them. Then I begin turning everything upside down, lifting the corner of this incident, prying under that no bit of talk, recalling what he said and who told of it (I shall have the whole drawer empty before I get through), and whose fault it was that the match was broken off, and why she, of all women in the world, should have remained single all those years. Why, too, she should have lost her identity, so to speak, and become the Little Gray Lady.\n\nAnd yet no sobriquet could better express her personality: She was little\u2014a dainty, elf-like littleness, with tiny feet and wee hands; she was gray\u2014a soft, silver gray\u2014too gray for her forty years (and this fragment begins when she was forty); and she was a lady in every beat of her warm heart; in every pressure of her white hand; in her voice, speech\u2014in all her thoughts and movements.\n\nShe lived in the quaintest of old houses fronted by a brick path bordered with fragrant box, which led up to an old-fashioned porch, its door brightened by a brass knocker. This, together with the knobs, steps, and slits of windows on each side of the door, was kept scrupulously clean by old Margaret, who had lived with her for years.\n\nBut it is her personality and not her surroundings that lingers in my memory. No one ever heard anything sweeter than her voice; in and nobody ever looked into a lovelier face, even if there were little hollows in the cheeks and shy, fanlike wrinkles lurking about the corners of her lambent brown eyes. Nor did her gray hair mar her beauty. It was not old, dry, and withered\u2014a wispy gray. (That is not the way it happened.) It was a new, all-of-a-sudden gray, and in less than a week\u2014so Margaret once told me\u2014bleaching its brown gold to silver. But the gloss remained, and so did the richness of the folds, and the wealth and weight of it.\n\nInside the green-painted door, with its white trim and brass knocker and knobs, there was a narrow hall hung with old portraits, opening into a room literally all fireplace. Here there were gouty sofas, and five or six big easy-chairs ranged in a half-circle, with arms held out as if begging somebody to sit in them; and here, too, was an embroidered worsted fire screen that slid up and down a standard, to shield one\u2019s face from the blazing logs; and there were queer tables and old-gold curtains looped back with brass rosettes\u2014ears really\u2014behind which the tresses of the parted curtains were tucked; and there were more old portraits in dingy frames, and samplers under glass, and a rug which some aunt had made with her own hands from odds and ends; and a huge work-basket spilling worsteds, and last, and by no manner of means least, a big chintz-covered rocking-chair, the little lady\u2019s very own\u2014its thin ankles and splay feet hidden by a modest frill. There were all these things and a lot more\u2014and yet I still maintain that the room was just one big fireplace. Not alone because of its size (and it certainly was big: many a doubting curly head, losing its faith in Santa Claus, has crawled behind the old fire-dogs, the child\u2019s fingers tight about the Little Gray Lady\u2019s, and been told to look up into the blue\u2014a lesson never forgotten all their lives), but because of the wonderful and never-to-be-told-of things which constantly took place before its blazing embers.\n\nFor this fireplace was the Little Gray Lady\u2019s altar. Here she dispensed wisdom and cheer and love. Everybody in Pomford village had sat in one or the other of the chairs grouped about it and had poured out their hearts to her. All sorts of pourings: love affairs, for instance, that were hopeless until she would take the girl\u2019s hand in her own and smooth out the tangle; to-say nothing of bickerings behind closed doors, with two lives pulling apart until her dear arms brought them together.\n\nBut all this is only the outside of the old mahogany high-boy with its meerschaum-pipe polish, spraddling legs, and rattling handles.\n\nNow for the Little Gray Lady\u2019s own particular drawer.\n\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nIt was Christmas Eve, and Kate Dayton, one of Pomford\u2019s pretty girls, had found the Little Gray Lady sitting alone before the fire gazing into the ashes, her small frame almost hidden in the roomy chair. The winter twilight had long since settled and only the flickering blaze of the logs and the dim glow from one lone candle illumined the room. This, strange to say, was placed on a table in a corner where its rays shed but little light in the room.\n\n\u201cOh! Cousin Annie,\u201d moaned Kate (everybody in Pomford who got close enough to touch the Little Gray Lady\u2019s hand called her \u201cCousin Annie\u201d\u2014it was only the outside world who knew her by her other sobriquet), \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything. Mark came in just at the wrong minute, and\u2014and\u2014\u201d The poor girl\u2019s tears smothered the rest.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let him go, dearie,\u201d came the answer, when she had heard the whole story, the girl on her knees, her head in her lap, the wee hand stroking the fluff of golden hair dishevelled in her grief.\n\n\u201cOh, but he won\u2019t stay!\u201d moaned Kate. \u201cHe says he is going to Rio\u2014way out to South America to join his Uncle Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t go, dearie\u2014not if you tell him the truth and make him tell you the truth. Don\u2019t let your pride come in; don\u2019t beat around the bush or make believe you are hurt or misunderstood, or that you don\u2019t care. You do care. Better be a little humble now than humble all your life. It only takes a word. Hold out your hand and say: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Mark\u2014please forgive me.\u2019 If he loves you\u2014and he does\u2014\u201d\n\nThe girl raised her head: \u201cOh! Cousin Annie! How do you know?\u201d\n\nShe laughed gently. \u201cBecause he was here, dearie, half an hour ago and told me so. He thought you owed him the dance, and he was a little jealous of Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Tom had asked me\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014and so had Mark\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014but he had no right\u2014\u201d She was up in arms again: she wouldn\u2019t\u2014she couldn\u2019t\u2014and again an outburst of tears choked her words.\n\nThe Little Gray Lady had known Kate\u2019s mother, now dead, and what might have happened but for a timely word\u2014and she knew to her own sorrow what had happened for want of one. Kate and Mark should not repeat that experience if she could help it. She had saved the mother in the old days by just such a word. She would save the daughter in the same way. And the two were much alike\u2014same slight, girlish figure; same blond hair and blue eyes; same expression, and the same impetuous, high-strung temperament. \u201cIf that child\u2019s own mother walked in this minute I couldn\u2019t tell \u2018em apart, they do favor one another so,\u201d old Margaret had told her mistress when she opened the door for the girl, and she was right. Pomford village was full of these hereditary likenesses. Mark Dab-ney, whom all the present trouble was about, was so like his father at his age that his Uncle Harry had picked Mark out on a crowded dock when the lad had visited him in Rio the year before, although he had not seen the boy\u2019s father for twenty years\u2014so strong was the family likeness.\n\nIf there was to be a quarrel it must not be between the Dabneys and the Daytons, of all families. There had been suffering enough in the old days.\n\n\u201cListen, dearie,\u201d she said in her gentle, crooning tone, patting the girl\u2019s cheek as she talked. \u201cA quarrel where there is no love is soon forgotten, but a difference when both love may, if not quickly healed, leave a scar that will last through life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are as good fish in the sea as were ever caught,\u201d cried the girl in sheer bravado, brushing away her tears.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe it, dearie\u2014and don\u2019t ever say it. That has wrecked more lives than you know. That is what I once knew a girl to say\u2014a girl just about your age\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she found somebody else, and that\u2019s just what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m not going to have Mark read me a lecture every time I want to do something he doesn\u2019t like. Didn\u2019t your girl find somebody else?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014never. She is still unmarried.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014but it wasn\u2019t her fault, was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014although she did not know it at the time. She opened a door suddenly and found her lover alone with another girl. The two had stolen off together where they would not be interrupted. He was pleading for his college friend\u2014straightening out just some such foolish quarrel as you have had with Mark\u2014but the girl would not understand; nor did she know the truth until a year afterward. Then it was too late.\u201d\n\nThe Little Gray Lady stopped, lifted her hand from the girl\u2019s head, and turned her face toward the now dying fire.\n\n\u201cAnd what became of him?\u201d asked the girl in a hushed voice, as if she dared not awaken the memory.\n\n\u201cHe went away and she has never seen him since.\u201d\n\nFor some minutes there was silence, then Kate said in a braver tone:\n\n\u201cAnd he married somebody else?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, she died?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThe Littie Lady had not moved, nor had she taken her eyes from the blaze. She seemed to be addressing some invisible body who could hear and understand. The girl felt its influence and a tremor ran through her. The fitful blaze casting weird shadows helped this feeling. At last, with an effort, she asked:\n\n\u201cYou say you know them both, Cousin Annie?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014he was my dear friend. I was just thinking of him when you came in.\u201d\n\nThe charred logs broke into a heap of coals; the blaze flickered and died. But for the lone candle in the corner the room would have been in total darkness.\n\n\u201cShall I light another candle, Cousin Annie?\u201d shivered the girl, \u201cor bring that one nearer?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s Christmas Eve, and I only light one candle on Christmas Eve.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s one candle! Why, father has the whole house as bright as day and every fire blazing.\u201d The girl sprang to her feet and stepped nearer the hearth. She would be less nervous, she thought, if she moved about, and then the warmth of the fire was somehow reassuring. \u201cPlease let me light them all, Cousin Annie,\u201d she pleaded, reaching out her hand toward a cluster in an old-fashioned candelabra\u2014\u201cand if there aren\u2019t enough I\u2019ll get more from Margaret.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no\u2014one will do. It is an old custom of mine; I\u2019ve done it for twenty years.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you love Christmas?\u201d Kate argued, her nervousness increasing. The ghostly light and the note of pain in her companion\u2019s voice were strangely affecting.\n\nThe Little Gray Lady leaned forward in her chair and looked long and steadily at the heap of smouldering ashes; then she answered slowly, each word vibrating with the memory of some hidden sorrow: \u201cI\u2019ve had mine, dearie.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you can have some more,\u201d urged Kate.\n\n\u201cNot like those that have gone before, dearie\u2014no, not like those.\u201d\n\nSomething in the tones of her voice and quick droop of the dear head stirred the girl to her depths. Sinking to her knees she hid her face in the Little Lady\u2019s lap.\n\n\u201cAnd you sit here in the dark with only one candle?\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cYes, always,\u201d she answered, her fingers stroking the fair hair. \u201cI can see those I have loved better in the dark. Sometimes the room is full of people; I have often to strain my eyes to assure myself that the door is really shut. All sorts of people come\u2014the girls and boys I knew when I was young. Some are dead; some are far away; some so near that should I open the window and shout their names many of them could hear. There are fewer above ground every year\u2014but I welcome all who come. It\u2019s the old maid\u2019s hour, you know\u2014this twilight hour. The wives are making ready the supper; the children are romping; lovers are together in the corner where they can whisper and not be overheard. But none of this disturbs me\u2014no big man bursts in, letting in the cold. I have my chair, my candle, my thoughts, and my fire. When you get to be my age, Kate, and live alone\u2014and you might, dearie, if Mark should leave you\u2014you will love these twilight hours, too.\u201d\n\nThe girl reached up her hands and touched the Little Gray Lady\u2019s cheek, whispering:\n\n\u201cBut aren\u2019t you very, very lonely. Cousin Annie?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sometimes.\u201d\n\nFor a moment Kate remained silent, then she asked in a faltering voice through which ran a note almost of terror:\n\n\u201cDo you think I shall ever be like\u2014like\u2014that is\u2014I shall ever be\u2014all alone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, dearie. No one can ever tell what will happen. I never thought twenty years ago I should be all alone\u2014but I am.\u201d\n\nThe girl raised her head, and with a cry of pain threw her arms around the Little Gray Lady\u2019s neck:\n\n\u201cOh, no!\u2014no! I can\u2019t bear it!\u201d she sobbed! \u201cI\u2019ll tell Mark! I\u2019ll send for him\u2014to-night-before I go to bed!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nIt was not until Kate Dayton reached her father\u2019s gate that the spell wrought by the flickering firelight and the dim glow of the ghostly candle wore off. The crisp air of the winter night\u2014for it was now quite dark\u2014had helped, but the sight of Mark\u2019s waiting figure striding along the snow-covered path to her home and his manly outspoken apology, \u201cPlease forgive me, Kate, I made an awful fool of myself,\u201d followed by her joyous refrain, \u201cOh, Mark! I\u2019ve been so wretched!\u201d had done more. It had all come just as Cousin Annie had said; there had been neither pride nor anger. Only the Little Gray Lady\u2019s timely word.\n\nBut if the spell was broken the pathetic figure of the dear woman, her eyes fixed on the dying embers, still lingered in Kate\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cOh, Mark, it is so pitiful to see her!\u2014and I got so frightened; the whole room seemed filled with ghosts. Christmas seems her loneliest time. She won\u2019t have but one candle lighted, and she sits and mopes in the dark. Oh, it\u2019s dreadful! I tried to cheer her up, but she says she likes to sit in the dark, because then all the dead people she loves can come to her. Can\u2019t we do something to make her happy? She is so lovely, and she is so little, and she is so dear!\u201d\n\nThey had entered the house, now a blaze of light. Kate\u2019s father was standing on the hearth rug, his back to a great fireplace filled with roaring logs.\n\n\u201cWhere have you two gadabouts been?\u201d he laughed merrily. \u201cWhat do you mean by staying out this late? Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s Christmas Eve?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been to see Cousin Annie, daddy; and it would make your heart ache to look at her! She\u2019s there all alone. Can\u2019t you go down and bring her up here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I could, but she wouldn\u2019t come, not on Christmas Eve. Did she have her candle burning?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, just one poor little miserable candle that hardly gave any light at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it was in the corner on a little table?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, all by itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor dear, she always lights it. She\u2019s lighted it for almost twenty years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it for somebody she loved who died?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014it\u2019s for somebody she loved who is alive, but who never came back and won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe studied them both for a moment, as if in doubt, then he added in a determined voice, motioning them to a seat beside him:\n\n\u201cIt is about time you two children heard the story straight, for it concerns you both, so I\u2019ll tell you. Your Uncle Harry, Mark, is the man who never came back and won\u2019t. He was just your age at the time. He and Annie were to be married in a few months, then everything went to smash. And it was your mother, Kate, who was the innocent cause of his exile. Harry, who was the best friend I had in the world, tried to put in a good word for me\u2014this was before I and your mother were engaged\u2014and Annie, coming in and finding them, got it all crooked. Instead of waiting until Harry could explain, she flared up, and off he went. Her hair turned white in a week when she found out how she had misjudged him, but it was too late then\u2014Harry wouldn\u2019t come back, and he never will. When he told you, Mark, last year in Rio that he was coming home Christmas I knew he\u2019d change his mind just as soon as you left him, and he did. Queer boy, Harry. Once he gets an idea in his head it sticks there. He was that way when he was a boy. He\u2019ll never come back as long as Annie lives, and that means never.\u201d\n\nHe stopped a moment, spread his fingers to the blazing logs, and then, with a smile on his face, said: \u201cIf ever I catch you two young turtledoves making such fools of yourselves, I\u2019ll turn you both outdoors,\u201d and again his hearty laugh rang through the cheery room.\n\nThe girl instinctively leaned closer to her lover. She had heard some part of the story before\u2014in fact, both of them had, but never in its entirety. Her heart went out to the Little Gray Lady all the more.\n\nMark now spoke up. He, too, had had an hour of his own with the Little Gray Lady, and the obligation still remained unsettled.\n\n\u201cWell, if she won\u2019t come up here and have Christmas with us,\u201d he cried, \u201cwhy can\u2019t we go down there and have Christmas with her? Let\u2019s surprise her, Kate; let\u2019s clean out all those dead people. I know she sits in the dark and imagines they all come back, for I\u2019ve seen her that way many a time when I drop in on her in the late afternoon. Let\u2019s show her they\u2019re alive.\u201d\n\nKate started up and caught Mark\u2019s arm. \u201cOh, Mark! I have it!\u201d she whispered, \u201cand we will\u2014yes\u2014that will be the very thing,\u201d and so with more mumblings and mutterings, not one word of which could her father hear, the two raced up-stairs to the top of the house and the garret.\n\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTwo hours later a group of young people led by Mark Dabney trooped out of Kate\u2019s gate and turned down the Little Gray Lady\u2019s street. Most of them wore long cloaks and were muffled in thick veils.\n\nThey were talking in low tones, glancing from side to side, as if fearing to be seen. The moon had gone under a cloud, but the light of the stars, aided by an isolated street lamp, showed them the way. So careful were they to conceal their identity that the whole party\u2014there were six in all\u2014would dart into an open gate, crouching behind the snow-laden hedge to avoid even a single passer-by. Only once were they in any danger, and that was when a sleigh gliding by stopped in front of them, the driver calling out in a voice which sounded twice as loud in the white stillness: \u201cWhere\u2019s Mr. Dabney\u2019s new house?\u201d (evidently a stranger, for the town pump was not better known). No one else stopped them until they reached the Little Gray Lady\u2019s porch.\n\nKate crept up first, followed by Mark, and peered in. So far as she could see everything was just as she had left it.\n\n\u201cThe candle is still burning, Mark, and she\u2019s put more wood on the fire. But I can\u2019t find her. Oh, yes\u2014there she is\u2014in her big chair\u2014you can just see the top of her head and her hand. Hush! don\u2019t one of you breathe. Now, listen, girls! Mark and I will tiptoe in first\u2014the front door is never fastened\u2014and if she is asleep\u2014and I think she is\u2014we will all crouch down behind her until she wakes up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd another thing,\u201d whispered Mark from behind his hand\u2014\u201ceverybody must drop their coats and things in the hall, so we can surprise her all at once.\u201d\n\nThe strange procession tiptoed in and arranged itself behind the Little Gray Lady\u2019s chair. Kate was dressed in her mother\u2019s wedding-gown, flaring poke bonnet, and long, faded gloves clear to her shoulder; Mark had on a blue coat with brass buttons, a buff waistcoat, and black stock, the two points of the high collar pinching his ruddy cheeks\u2014the same dress his father and Uncle Harry had worn, and all the young bloods of their day, for that matter. The others were in their grandmother\u2019s or grandfather\u2019s short and long clothes, Tom Fields sporting a tight-sleeved, high-collared coat, silk-embroidered waistcoat, and pumps.\n\nKate crept up behind her chair, but Mark moved to the fireplace and rested his elbow on the mantel, so that he would be in full view when the Little Gray Lady awoke.\n\nAt last her eyes opened, but she made no outcry, nor did she move, except to lift her head as does a fawn startled by some sudden light, her wondering eyes drinking in the apparition. Mark, hardly breathing, stood like a statue, but Kate, bending closer, heard her catch her breath with a long, indrawn sigh, and next the half-audible words: \u201cNo\u2014it isn\u2019t so\u2014How foolish I am\u2014\u201d Then there came softly: \u201cHarry\u201d\u2014and again in almost a whisper\u2014as if hope had died in her heart\u2014\u201cHarry\u2014\u201d\n\nKate, half frightened, sprang forward and flung her arms around the Little Gray Lady.\n\n\u201cWhy, don\u2019t you know him? It\u2019s Mark, Cousin Annie, and here\u2019s Tom and Nanny Fields, and everybody, and we\u2019re going to light all the candles\u2014every one of them, and make an awful big fire\u2014and have a real, real Christmas.\u201d\n\nThe Little Gray Lady was awake now.\n\n\u201cOh! you scared me so!\u201d she cried, rising to her feet, rubbing her eyes. \u201cYou foolish Children! I must have been asleep\u2014yes, I know I was!\u201d She greeted them all, talking and entering into their fun, the spirit of hospitality now hers, saying over and over again how glad she was they came, kissing one and another; telling them how happy they made her; how since they had been kind enough to come, she would let them have a real Christmas\u2014\u201cOnly,\u201d she added quickly, \u201cit will have to be by the light of one candle; but that won\u2019t make any difference, because you can pile on just as much wood as you choose. Yes,\u201d she continued, her voice rising in her effort to meet them on their own joyous plane\u2014\u201cpile on all the kindling, too, Mark; and Kate, dear, please run and tell Margaret to bring in every bit of cake she has in the pantry. Oh, how like your mother you are, Kate! I remember that very dress. And you, Mark! Why, you\u2019ve got on the same coat I saw your father wear at the Governor\u2019s ball. And you, too, Tom. Oh, what a good time we will all have!\u201d\n\nSoon the lid of the old piano was raised, a spinet, really, and one of the girls began running her fingers over the keys; and later on it was agreed that the first dance was to be the Virginia reel, with all the hospitable chairs and the fire screen and the gouty old sofa rolled back against the wall.\n\nThis all arranged, Mark took his place with the Little Gray Lady for a partner. The music struck up a lively tune and as quickly ceased as the sound of bells rang through the night air. In the hush that followed a sleigh was heard at the gate.\n\nKate sprang up and clapped her hands.\n\n\u201cOh, they are just in time! There come the rest of them, Cousin Annie. Now we are going to have a great party! Let\u2019s be dancing when they come in; keep on playing!\u201d\n\nAt this instant the door opened and Margaret put in her head. \u201cSomebody,\u201d she said, with a low bow, \u201cwants to see Mr. Mark on business.\u201d\n\nMark, looking like a gallant of the old school, excused himself with a great flourish to the Little Gray Lady and strode out. In the hall, with his back to the light, stood a broad-shouldered man muffled to the chin in a fur overcoat. The boy was about to apologize for his costume and then ask the man\u2019s errand, when the stranger turned quickly and gripped his wrist.\n\n\u201cHush\u2014not a word! Where is she?\u201d he cried.\n\nWith a low whistle of surprise Mark pushed open the door. The stranger stepped in.\n\nThe Little Gray Lady raised her head.\n\n\u201cAnd who can this new guest be?\u201d she asked\u2014\u201cand in what a queer costume, too!\u201d\n\nThe man drew himself up to his full height and threw wide his coat: \u201cAnd you don\u2019t know me, Annie?\u201d\n\nShe did not take her eyes from his face, nor did she move except to turn her head appealingly to the room as if she feared they were playing her another trick.\n\nHe had reached her side and stood looking down at her. Again came the voice\u2014a strong, clear voice, with a note of infinite tenderness through it:\n\n\u201cHow white your hair is, Annie; and your hand is so thin! Have I changed like this?\u201d\n\nShe leaned forward, scanning him eagerly.\n\nThere was a little cry, then all her soul went out in the one word:\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\n\nShe was inside the big coat now, his strong arms around her, her head hidden on his breast, only the tips of her toes on the floor.\n\nWhen he had kissed her again and again\u2014and he did and before everybody\u2014he crossed the room, picked up the ghostly candle, and smothered its flame.\n\n\u201cI saw it from the road,\u201d he laughed softly, \u201cthat\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t wait. But you\u2019ll never have to light it again, my darling!\u201d\n\nI saw them both a few years later. Everything in the way of fading and wrinkling had stopped so far as the Little Gray Lady was concerned. If there were any lines left in her forehead and around the corners of her eyes, I could not find them. Joy had planted a crop of dimples instead, and they had spread out, smoothing the care lines. Margaret even claimed that her hair was turning brown gold once more, but then Margaret was always her loyal slave, and believed everything her mistress wished.\n\nAnd now, if you don\u2019t mind, dear reader, we will put everything back and shut the Little Gray Lady\u2019s bureau drawer. "},{title:"The Yellow Wallpaper",author:"Charlotte Perkins Gilman",gender:"Female",text:" It is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure ancestral halls for the summer.\n\nA colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach the height of romantic felicity\u2014but that would be asking too much of fate!\n\nStill I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it.\n\nElse, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long untenanted?\n\nJohn laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.\n\nJohn is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an intense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.\n\nJohn is a physician, and perhaps\u2014(I would not say it to a living soul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind)\u2014perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster.\n\nYou see, he does not believe I am sick!\n\nAnd what can one do?\n\nIf a physician of high standing, and one\u2019s own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression\u2014a slight hysterical tendency\u2014what is one to do?\n\nMy brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says the same thing.\n\nSo I take phosphates or phosphites\u2014whichever it is, and tonics, and journeys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to \u201cwork\u201d until I am well again.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with their ideas.\n\nPersonally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change, would do me good.\n\nBut what is one to do?\n\nI did write for a while in spite of them; but it does exhaust me a good deal\u2014having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.\n\nI sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus\u2014but John says the very worst thing I can do is to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.\n\nSo I will let it alone and talk about the house.\n\nThe most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people.\n\nThere is a delicious garden! I never saw such a garden\u2014large and shady, full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors with seats under them.\n\nThere were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.\n\nThere was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and co-heirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.\n\nThat spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but I don\u2019t care\u2014there is something strange about the house\u2014I can feel it.\n\nI even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt was a draught, and shut the window.\n\nI get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I\u2019m sure I never used to be so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.\n\nBut John says if I feel so I shall neglect proper self-control; so I take pains to control myself,\u2014before him, at least,\u2014and that makes me very tired.\n\nI don\u2019t like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned chintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.\n\nHe said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near room for him if he took another.\n\nHe is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special direction.\n\nI have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.\n\nHe said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect rest and all the air I could get. \u201cYour exercise depends on your strength, my dear,\u201d said he, \u201cand your food somewhat on your appetite; but air you can absorb all the time.\u201d So we took the nursery, at the top of the house.\n\nIt is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look all ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then playground and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred for little children, and there are rings and things in the walls.\n\nThe paint and paper look as if a boys\u2019 school had used it. It is stripped off\u2014the paper\u2014in great patches all around the head of my bed, about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of the room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.\n\nOne of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin.\n\nIt is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough to constantly irritate, and provoke study, and when you follow the lame, uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide\u2014plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard-of contradictions.\n\nThe color is repellant, almost revolting; a smouldering, unclean yellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.\n\nIt is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in others.\n\nNo wonder the children hated it! I should hate it myself if I had to live in this room long.\n\nThere comes John, and I must put this away,\u2014he hates to have me write a word.\n\nWe have been here two weeks, and I haven\u2019t felt like writing before, since that first day.\n\nI am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and there is nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of strength.\n\nJohn is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.\n\nI am glad my case is not serious!\n\nBut these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.\n\nJohn does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no reason to suffer, and that satisfies him.\n\nOf course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way!\n\nI meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and here I am a comparative burden already!\n\nNobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am able\u2014to dress and entertain, and order things.\n\nIt is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby!\n\nAnd yet I cannot be with him, it makes me so nervous.\n\nI suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about this wallpaper!\n\nAt first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I was letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such fancies.\n\nHe said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy bedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head of the stairs, and so on.\n\n\u201cYou know the place is doing you good,\u201d he said, \u201cand really, dear, I don\u2019t care to renovate the house just for a three months\u2019 rental.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen do let us go downstairs,\u201d I said, \u201cthere are such pretty rooms there.\u201d\n\nThen he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose, and said he would go down cellar if I wished, and have it whitewashed into the bargain.\n\nBut he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.\n\nIt is as airy and comfortable a room as any one need wish, and, of course, I would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a whim.\n\nI\u2019m really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid paper.\n\nOut of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deep-shaded arbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.\n\nOut of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try.\n\nI think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it would relieve the press of ideas and rest me.\n\nBut I find I get pretty tired when I try.\n\nIt is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work. When I get really well John says we will ask Cousin Henry and Julia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put fire-works in my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people about now.\n\nI wish I could get well faster.\n\nBut I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it knew what a vicious influence it had!\n\nThere is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and two bulbous eyes stare at you upside-down.\n\nI get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the everlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd, unblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths didn\u2019t match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little higher than the other.\n\nI never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all know how much expression they have! I used to lie awake as a child and get more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain furniture than most children could find in a toy-store.\n\nI remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big old bureau used to have, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend.\n\nI used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce I could always hop into that chair and be safe.\n\nThe furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for we had to bring it all from downstairs. I suppose when this was used as a playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I never saw such ravages as the children have made here.\n\nThe wallpaper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh closer than a brother\u2014they must have had perseverance as well as hatred.\n\nThen the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster itself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed, which is all we found in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.\n\nBut I don\u2019t mind it a bit\u2014only the paper.\n\nThere comes John\u2019s sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful of me! I must not let her find me writing.\n\nShe is a perfect, and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better profession. I verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me sick!\n\nBut I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these windows.\n\nThere is one that commands the road, a lovely, shaded, winding road, and one that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too, full of great elms and velvet meadows.\n\nThis wallpaper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a particularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights, and not clearly then.\n\nBut in the places where it isn\u2019t faded, and where the sun is just so, I can see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to sulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.\n\nThere\u2019s sister on the stairs!\n\nWell, the Fourth of July is over! The people are gone and I am tired out. John thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we just had mother and Nellie and the children down for a week.\n\nOf course I didn\u2019t do a thing. Jennie sees to everything now.\n\nBut it tired me all the same.\n\nJohn says if I don\u2019t pick up faster he shall send me to Weir Mitchell in the fall.\n\nBut I don\u2019t want to go there at all. I had a friend who was in his hands once, and she says he is just like John and my brother, only more so!\n\nBesides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.\n\nI don\u2019t feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for anything, and I\u2019m getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.\n\nI cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.\n\nOf course I don\u2019t when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am alone.\n\nAnd I am alone a good deal just now. John is kept in town very often by serious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.\n\nSo I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the porch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.\n\nI\u2019m getting really fond of the room in spite of the wallpaper. Perhaps because of the wallpaper.\n\nIt dwells in my mind so!\n\nI lie here on this great immovable bed\u2014it is nailed down, I believe\u2014and follow that pattern about by the hour. It is as good as gymnastics, I assure you. I start, we\u2019ll say, at the bottom, down in the corner over there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the thousandth time that I will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a conclusion.\n\nI know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was not arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition, or symmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.\n\nIt is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.\n\nLooked at in one way each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and flourishes\u2014a kind of \u201cdebased Romanesque\u201d with delirium tremens\u2014go waddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.\n\nBut, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of wallowing seaweeds in full chase.\n\nThe whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I exhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that direction.\n\nThey have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds wonderfully to the confusion.\n\nThere is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when the cross-lights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can almost fancy radiation after all,\u2014the interminable grotesques seem to form around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal distraction.\n\nIt makes me tired to follow it. I will take a nap, I guess.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I should write this.\n\nI don\u2019t want to.\n\nI don\u2019t feel able.\n\nAnd I know John would think it absurd. But I must say what I feel and think in some way\u2014it is such a relief!\n\nBut the effort is getting to be greater than the relief.\n\nHalf the time now I am awfully lazy, and lie down ever so much.\n\nJohn says I musn\u2019t lose my strength, and has me take cod-liver oil and lots of tonics and things, to say nothing of ale and wine and rare meat.\n\nDear John! He loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick. I tried to have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell him how I wish he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and Julia.\n\nBut he said I wasn\u2019t able to go, nor able to stand it after I got there; and I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was crying before I had finished.\n\nIt is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this nervous weakness, I suppose.\n\nAnd dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my head.\n\nHe said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I must take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.\n\nHe says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my will and self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me.\n\nThere\u2019s one comfort, the baby is well and happy, and does not have to occupy this nursery with the horrid wallpaper.\n\nIf we had not used it that blessed child would have! What a fortunate escape! Why, I wouldn\u2019t have a child of mine, an impressionable little thing, live in such a room for worlds.\n\nI never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here after all. I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.\n\nOf course I never mention it to them any more,\u2014I am too wise,\u2014but I keep watch of it all the same.\n\nThere are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.\n\nBehind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.\n\nIt is always the same shape, only very numerous.\n\nAnd it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that pattern. I don\u2019t like it a bit. I wonder\u2014I begin to think\u2014I wish John would take me away from here!\n\nIt is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise, and because he loves me so.\n\nBut I tried it last night.\n\nIt was moonlight. The moon shines in all around, just as the sun does.\n\nI hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by one window or another.\n\nJohn was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched the moonlight on that undulating wallpaper till I felt creepy.\n\nThe faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she wanted to get out.\n\nI got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper did move, and when I came back John was awake.\n\n\u201cWhat is it, little girl?\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t go walking about like that\u2014you\u2019ll get cold.\u201d\n\nI thought it was a good time to talk, so I told him that I really was not gaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.\n\n\u201cWhy darling!\u201d said he, \u201cour lease will be up in three weeks, and I can\u2019t see how to leave before.\n\n\u201cThe repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town just now. Of course if you were in any danger I could and would, but you really are better, dear, whether you can see it or not. I am a doctor, dear, and I know. You are gaining flesh and color, your appetite is better. I feel really much easier about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t weigh a bit more,\u201d said I, \u201cnor as much; and my appetite may be better in the evening, when you are here, but it is worse in the morning when you are away.\u201d\n\n\u201cBless her little heart!\u201d said he with a big hug; \u201cshe shall be as sick as she pleases! But now let\u2019s improve the shining hours by going to sleep, and talk about it in the morning!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you won\u2019t go away?\u201d I asked gloomily.\n\n\u201cWhy, how can I, dear? It is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while Jennie is getting the house ready. Really, dear, you are better!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter in body perhaps\u201d\u2014I began, and stopped short, for he sat up straight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I could not say another word.\n\n\u201cMy darling,\u201d said he, \u201cI beg of you, for my sake and for our child\u2019s sake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let that idea enter your mind! There is nothing so dangerous, so fascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish fancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?\u201d\n\nSo of course I said no more on that score, and we went to sleep before long. He thought I was asleep first, but I wasn\u2019t,\u2014I lay there for hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern really did move together or separately.\n\nOn a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a defiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind.\n\nThe color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating enough, but the pattern is torturing.\n\nYou think you have mastered it, but just as you get well under way in following, it turns a back somersault and there you are. It slaps you in the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you. It is like a bad dream.\n\nThe outside pattern is a florid arabesque, reminding one of a fungus. If you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable string of toadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions,\u2014why, that is something like it.\n\nThat is, sometimes!\n\nThere is one marked peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems to notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.\n\nWhen the sun shoots in through the east window\u2014I always watch for that first long, straight ray\u2014it changes so quickly that I never can quite believe it.\n\nThat is why I watch it always.\n\nBy moonlight\u2014the moon shines in all night when there is a moon\u2014I wouldn\u2019t know it was the same paper.\n\nAt night in any kind of light, in twilight, candlelight, lamplight, and worst of all by moonlight, it becomes bars! The outside pattern I mean, and the woman behind it is as plain as can be.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind,\u2014that dim sub-pattern,\u2014but now I am quite sure it is a woman.\n\nBy daylight she is subdued, quiet. I fancy it is the pattern that keeps her so still. It is so puzzling. It keeps me quiet by the hour.\n\nI lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep all I can.\n\nIndeed, he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after each meal.\n\nIt is a very bad habit, I am convinced, for, you see, I don\u2019t sleep.\n\nAnd that cultivates deceit, for I don\u2019t tell them I\u2019m awake,\u2014oh, no!\n\nThe fact is, I am getting a little afraid of John.\n\nHe seems very queer sometimes, and even Jennie has an inexplicable look.\n\nIt strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis, that perhaps it is the paper!\n\nI have watched John when he did not know I was looking, and come into the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I\u2019ve caught him several times looking at the paper! And Jennie too. I caught Jennie with her hand on it once.\n\nShe didn\u2019t know I was in the room, and when I asked her in a quiet, a very quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she was doing with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught stealing, and looked quite angry\u2014asked me why I should frighten her so!\n\nThen she said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she had found yellow smooches on all my clothes and John\u2019s, and she wished we would be more careful!\n\nDid not that sound innocent? But I know she was studying that pattern, and I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!\n\nLife is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have something more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat better, and am more quiet than I was.\n\nJohn is so pleased to see me improve! He laughed a little the other day, and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wallpaper.\n\nI turned it off with a laugh. I had no intention of telling him it was because of the wallpaper\u2014he would make fun of me. He might even want to take me away.\n\nI don\u2019t want to leave now until I have found it out. There is a week more, and I think that will be enough.\n\nI\u2019m feeling ever so much better! I don\u2019t sleep much at night, for it is so interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the daytime.\n\nIn the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.\n\nThere are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all over it. I cannot keep count of them, though I have tried conscientiously.\n\nIt is the strangest yellow, that wallpaper! It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw\u2014not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things.\n\nBut there is something else about that paper\u2014the smell! I noticed it the moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was not bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the windows are open or not, the smell is here.\n\nIt creeps all over the house.\n\nI find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding in the hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.\n\nIt gets into my hair.\n\nEven when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise it\u2014there is that smell!\n\nSuch a peculiar odor, too! I have spent hours in trying to analyze it, to find what it smelled like.\n\nIt is not bad\u2014at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most enduring odor I ever met.\n\nIn this damp weather it is awful. I wake up in the night and find it hanging over me.\n\nIt used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the house\u2014to reach the smell.\n\nBut now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like is the color of the paper! A yellow smell.\n\nThere is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard. A streak that runs round the room. It goes behind every piece of furniture, except the bed, a long, straight, even smooch, as if it had been rubbed over and over.\n\nI wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for. Round and round and round\u2014round and round and round\u2014it makes me dizzy!\n\nI really have discovered something at last.\n\nThrough watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally found out.\n\nThe front pattern does move\u2014and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it!\n\nSometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over.\n\nThen in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady spots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.\n\nAnd she is all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb through that pattern\u2014it strangles so; I think that is why it has so many heads.\n\nThey get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them upside-down, and makes their eyes white!\n\nIf those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.\n\nI think that woman gets out in the daytime!\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you why\u2014privately\u2014I\u2019ve seen her!\n\nI can see her out of every one of my windows!\n\nIt is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most women do not creep by daylight.\n\nI see her on that long shaded lane, creeping up and down. I see her in those dark grape arbors, creeping all around the garden.\n\nI see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines.\n\nI don\u2019t blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating to be caught creeping by daylight!\n\nI always lock the door when I creep by daylight. I can\u2019t do it at night, for I know John would suspect something at once.\n\nAnd John is so queer now, that I don\u2019t want to irritate him. I wish he would take another room! Besides, I don\u2019t want anybody to get that woman out at night but myself.\n\nI often wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once.\n\nBut, turn as fast as I can, I can only see out of one at one time.\n\nAnd though I always see her she may be able to creep faster than I can turn!\n\nI have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.\n\nIf only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean to try it, little by little.\n\nI have found out another funny thing, but I shan\u2019t tell it this time! It does not do to trust people too much.\n\nThere are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John is beginning to notice. I don\u2019t like the look in his eyes.\n\nAnd I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me. She had a very good report to give.\n\nShe said I slept a good deal in the daytime.\n\nJohn knows I don\u2019t sleep very well at night, for all I\u2019m so quiet!\n\nHe asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very loving and kind.\n\nAs if I couldn\u2019t see through him!\n\nStill, I don\u2019t wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three months.\n\nIt only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly affected by it.\n\nHurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town over night, and won\u2019t be out until this evening.\n\nJennie wanted to sleep with me\u2014the sly thing! but I told her I should undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.\n\nThat was clever, for really I wasn\u2019t alone a bit! As soon as it was moonlight, and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I got up and ran to help her.\n\nI pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we had peeled off yards of that paper.\n\nA strip about as high as my head and half around the room.\n\nAnd then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me I declared I would finish it to-day!\n\nWe go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again to leave things as they were before.\n\nJennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her merrily that I did it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.\n\nShe laughed and said she wouldn\u2019t mind doing it herself, but I must not get tired.\n\nHow she betrayed herself that time!\n\nBut I am here, and no person touches this paper but me\u2014not alive!\n\nShe tried to get me out of the room\u2014it was too patent! But I said it was so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down again and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner\u2014I would call when I woke.\n\nSo now she is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone, and there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down, with the canvas mattress we found on it.\n\nWe shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.\n\nI quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.\n\nHow those children did tear about here!\n\nThis bedstead is fairly gnawed!\n\nBut I must get to work.\n\nI have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.\n\nI don\u2019t want to go out, and I don\u2019t want to have anybody come in, till John comes.\n\nI want to astonish him.\n\nI\u2019ve got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman does get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!\n\nBut I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!\n\nThis bed will not move!\n\nI tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I bit off a little piece at one corner\u2014but it hurt my teeth.\n\nThen I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with derision!\n\nI am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the window would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to try.\n\nBesides I wouldn\u2019t do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step like that is improper and might be misconstrued.\n\nI don\u2019t like to look out of the windows even\u2014there are so many of those creeping women, and they creep so fast.\n\nI wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper as I did?\n\nBut I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope\u2014you don\u2019t get me out in the road there!\n\nI suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night, and that is hard!\n\nIt is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I please!\n\nI don\u2019t want to go outside. I won\u2019t, even if Jennie asks me to.\n\nFor outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green instead of yellow.\n\nBut here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.\n\nWhy, there\u2019s John at the door!\n\nIt is no use, young man, you can\u2019t open it!\n\nHow he does call and pound!\n\nNow he\u2019s crying for an axe.\n\nIt would be a shame to break down that beautiful door!\n\n\u201cJohn dear!\u201d said I in the gentlest voice, \u201cthe key is down by the front steps, under a plantain leaf!\u201d\n\nThat silenced him for a few moments.\n\nThen he said\u2014very quietly indeed, \u201cOpen the door, my darling!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said I. \u201cThe key is down by the front door under a plantain leaf!\u201d\n\nAnd then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and said it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it, of course, and came in. He stopped short by the door.\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d he cried. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, what are you doing!\u201d\n\nI kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got out at last,\u201d said I, \u201cin spite of you and Jane! And I\u2019ve pulled off most of the paper, so you can\u2019t put me back!\u201d\n\nNow why should that man have fainted?
